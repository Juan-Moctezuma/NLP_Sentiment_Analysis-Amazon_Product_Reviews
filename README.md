# NLP Sentiment Analysis - Amazon Product Reviews

### Technical Description in Non-Technical Terms
This project’s goal is to analyze comments provided by customers by determining if the given review is associated with the following sentiment: ‘positive’, ‘negative’ or ‘neutral’; and to apply Ai-powered methods for predicting sentiment based on actual rated reviews provided by customers. In this data science project, we are exclusively analyzing reviews of every whey protein product currently available for sell at Amazon. Whey Protein powder is sporting supplement (based on dairy milk) consumed commonly by athletes, body-builders and anyone who wants or needs additional protein on their diet. How do we obtain our data? By scraping (automatically extracting) pages one through ten from the comments’ section for every single product available when searching for the terms ‘Whey Protein’ at Amazon’s (E-Commerce website) searchbar. What is the main tool for this project? We used Python 3 – programming language for both web scraping and applying both multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and statistical methods / data science prediction models.
