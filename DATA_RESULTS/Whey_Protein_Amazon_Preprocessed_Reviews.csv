I love this. I make it for myself and my kids as hot chocolate or “chocolate milk” and the taste is so good they have no idea it’s good for them. Other brands taste like medicine, this is just delicious. Always feel refreshed and energized afterwards which you cannot say for most hydration and electrolyte drinks! Will definitely keep buying it!!!

I like to work out regularly. This includes weight-lifting on some days and running on the treadmill for other days. Given how depleting it can be to run for prolonged periods of time, I like to have an electrolyte drink after my cardio days on the treadmill to try to restore my electrolytes. After having tried this electrolyte drink mix, I must say that I am rather impressed.This chocolate flavored hydration mix actually tastes better than I thought it would. I was a little bit hesitant as I have normally only had fruity-flavored electrolyte drink mixes before, and nothing I have had was similar to the rich flavor of chocolate. However, after having a mix with 8 ounces of water, I was surprised to note that it tasted like hot chocolate - although cold, because I did not use hot water. At 8 ounces of water, it did taste a bit watered down still. I believe that this drink will be most enjoyable if used with hot water or milk for a richer taste, and potentially with less water than they recommend (they recommend 8 to 16 ounces of water per stick).There are a couple of flaws that I have with this product. Firstly, the drink mix did not fully dissolve well. Some other electrolyte drink mixes that I have used have dissolved better than this one. Also, for this drink mix to be most enjoyable, I believe one should use milk or hot water (or hot milk, for that matter). This is an extra step versus with fruity flavors that can be very enjoyable in cold water (from the sink for me). As I enjoy convenience and wouldn't want to heat water each time before use, this is a flaw for me.I like how these sticks have a good vitamin profile. Each stick has significant amount of Vitamin C, B6, and B12, as well as some zinc. You're getting more than just electrolytes with these sticks. There are 2.5 grams of added sugar per stick, which is higher than I typically like as I try to avoid added sugar. But, there are only 10 calories per stick, so if you're a calorie counter, these might be for you.Given the rather affordable price of these electrolyte sticks ($36 for 30 sticks at the time of writing), I think that these could certainly be worth it for those who enjoy the hot chocolate flavor. Given the flaws that I personally have found with these, I will give them 4 stars.

This was a fun one and one of the more unique water additives I've tried. This is like having portable yoohoo everywhere you go! My only negative is that the flavor isn't as robust as the ""real thing"", but it's very, very good. The packets are strong and would be fine to travel with -- I had no concerns with the package being flimsy or difficult to open. The additive did dissolve fully for me, which is something that's a big point of interest for me. Flavor is good! Like watery chocolate, again, a neat and unique flavor additive. The packaging notes you can also try this hot, but I put this in cold water and enjoyed.

The powder is easily mixed into cool or hot water. I like that there are very few lumps. It tastes okay. I'm not sure of the sugar, calories, or electrolyte intake but, I did feel more energized after drinking it. I tried it cold and I liked it. My favorite way of drinking it is hot. The packets are easy to travel with and open. I like that they are conveniently made. Overall, I think it is a good product.

RECOMMENDATIONS:Recommended.The packets tastes great! Almost as good as regular hot chocolate, although you do taste that extra saltiness associated with hydration mixes.Honestly do not know if it works or not; how do you measure your body is getting hydration from a packet? I do notice that it makes me less thirsty throughout the morning after ingesting this, so there’s that.POSITIVES:- Tastes great for a hydration packet mix. If the packaging holds true, it also does not contain extra carbs either.- Portable; you can take these with you anywhere.- Highly dissolvable (is that a word?), you can use these with cold, hot drinks and anywhere in between.- Individual packets can easily be opened; no need for a knife or scrips or.NEGATIVES:- Nothing comes to mind, just hoping they work as advertised.IMPROVEMENTS:- None

The overall essence of chocolate is very light, but still noticeable. I preferred adding a stick to hot water as the chocolate flavor was very unappealing when combined with cold water on its own. The sticks themselves are durable, and wouldn't tear easily if left to bounce around freely at the bottom of a gym bag.

So I was hesitant to try this because most of the time when you think of drink mixes for hydration, you think of fruity flavors like lemonade or something - not chocolate. Especially when mixing with water… it just doesn’t sound good. BUT I was really surprised by how much I liked this product! I’ve only tried it with hot water (like a hot cocoa) and I was surprised by how much chocolate flavor there was. It would probably be better with warm milk but I wanted to try it with water first and I was not disappointed. Overall, I liked this and I will definitely use them for before/after workouts. I’m excited to try it with milk to see if it’s even better than with the water. Will update if I remember!

I was pleasantly surprised that this tasted as well as it does. Ingredients are pretty simple, and it contains a high DV of vitamins. I've been having these as a hot drink with hot water, and its like drinking hot cocoa. Its not as sweet or rich as regular hot cocoa, but its pretty close in my opinion. It does have that diet/alternative sugar taste, but it subtle to me so I don't notice it as much.This has been a nice to drink in the cold winter days especially in the morning. I tried putting it in my coffee but it doesn't seem to taste great with the blend I have. Maybe when the weather gets warmer I can try to to use these in smoothies. Overall, I've enjoyed these chocolate drinks and would recommend it for those looking for a healthier option!!

Actually tastes pretty good. There is a strong salty flavor, but the chocolate pairs well with it. Still, 250mg of sodium isn't terribly much for an ""electrolyte"" drink. I don't care for the smell of powder, but once mixed it is fine. It dissolves fairly easily and individual sachets make it easy to take a few with you when traveling. At a dollar per packet I don't think these are a great value, for example a chocolate protein powder would be a much better value.

These little packets, about a dollar each, claim to contain only 2.5g of sugar, packed with rehydrating electrolytes, essentially aimed at the fatigue relief and morning-after-the-party market segment. Suggesting it might replace an IV treatment to recharge the body with accelerated hydration might well be true, but we have no imperial evidence of such.The potassium, sodium, Vitamin C and magnesium and low sugar are certainly a good recipe for a morning lift -- an energizing boost to start the day -- and the chocolate flavor makes it all go down with ease.We keep them in our travel case for general jet lag symptoms and energy boost on long trips. It's good to have a few along in case of a touch of the hangover syndrome.

Sports fanatics in my household are on keto/fat burning/low carb exercise regimen, therefore we sampled this HydroMate Electrolyte-Enhanced Drink Mix.What works:Low carbs: 3g per serving.Low calories: 10 per serving, for those trying to burn fat.Each bag contains 16 (5.7g) sticks/servings for convenience.Chocolate/cocoa flavor tastes alright.Dissolves readily in Cold or Hot water.  Option to mix/shake with milk for thicker and creamier taste.Contains a good assortment of Vitamins, minerals, and salts (Sodium and Potassium) for hydration.No added caffeine for those of us sensitive to it.We all felt hydrated without muscle cramps during our training sessions.What may not work:This hydration mix only works well for our low intensity/aerobic exercise sessions of 45 minutes or less because it doesn't contain any significant calories (10) from carbs, fats, or proteins to fuel longer, higher intensity training/workouts.  YMMV

I’m unsure exactly how I feel about this electrolyte drink mix. They come in 30 individual packets which is nice and convenient. The package says to mix with 8-16 ounces of water, so I chose 8 because that’s a big gap. It does taste like chocolate, a little weak, but chocolate nonetheless. It’s kind of odd because when I taste chocolate I expect a level of “creaminess” and since this is to be mixed with water it’s not there lol. Overall it’s not bad, but I’m still unsure about how I feel.

I love the idea of using chocolate (instead of citrus or berry) as flavor for salt-based recovery products like electrolytes and BHB ketones. Chocolate complements the salt and masks the bitterness well.This powder is one of the tastier electrolyte drinks. No question about that. The ingredients are also well-considered. The one thing I wish were different is the sucralose. Sucralose, ace-k, sugar alcohols, and aspartame all can cause issues for people with allergies or diabetes or other sensitivities. There are better choices.

I don't normally think of ""chocolate"" when I'm thirsty or after a work out when I'm wanting something to hydrate.  But surprisingly, this works for me.I'm also not used to chocolate products that can be mixed with cold water.  But I mixed this with ice water and the product completely mixed with a little agitation.The packets are easy to open, but not so easy that there is a risk of opening by accident.The flavor is a little sweet, a little chocolatey... but not like chocolate milk.The description talks about a boost of energy.  But there isn't much sugar.  I don't see anything to indicate that it has caffeine (an artificial boost), or any other ingredient that would explain the energy boost.  But I can confirm that after my workout, I felt a little sluggish until I drank my HydroMATE drink.  That is to say... I did feel that I got a boost of energy.This is certainly travel friendly.  Weather you're traveling on a plane where you're only allowed to carry powders... or if you're just traveling to the gym.  Since this is an individual serving packet, you also don't have to measure and be concerned about making a mess.  The packets easily empty into a ""normal"" water bottle, so you don't even need a wide mouth.

The flavor is definitely chocolate and does taste good.  But for me I had a after taste, not bad after taste but there was one.  But after taking this to the gym and work I really didn't have the after taste anymore or I just got use to it.  Value for the money is ok at about $1.50 a drink it isn't that bad. (I've had better priced ones but not that great on flavor.)  I do wish it gave some protein with the drink, I'm not sure if it has any protein content but it would be nice to have some after working out.  I believe I would get this again because my kids like it and it is a good change from heavy sugar drinks out there.

I ordered these hydration packs despite my aversion to any hydration that isn't lemon/lime. I once ordered an apple cinnamon one and regretted it my whole hike. It was great at home but not much as thirst-quenching hydration. I was expecting this to taste like watered-down Yoohoo.You get the potassium chloride and all the other elements and vitamins you get with your sports drink, but this is an excellent way to start your morning. I tried it hot in coconut and almond milk, and in my coffee as a mocha with some cinnamon. I have dehydration from gut issues, so I get dehydrated after my third cup of coffee in the morning. This is an excellent addition to kick off your morning. The flavor is chocolatey and delicious without being overly sweet. And thanks to it being keto-friendly, I don't spike my sugar as I do with high-glucose sports drinks.You aren't going to fill your hydration pack with it for hiking, but a thermos of this hot chocolate for a hiking break is outstanding. A delicious treat that replaces essential elements lost while being active. My boyfriend has already mowed through 10 packets in 4 days!

I hate drinking plain water, so I am always on the hunt for things to add to my water bottle that will help me stay hydrated. I was a little skeptical about the chocolate flavor, but its not that bad. It is a bit weird with water; it kind of tastes like if you had a Yoohoo with ice, drank all the Yoohoo, let the ice melt a bit, and drank that. Just really watered down Yoohoo. Apparently you can make it hot or even add it to milk, so that might be tasty. I guess if you're really craving chocolate and this is the only way to get it, its clutch. Otherwise, it's just okay.

When I first came across this product I though 'what? That's weird'. But I do love chocolate and, as a competitive triathlete, I use hydration mixes frequently. I figured I needed to at least try it. Turns out this hydration mix is really good! I was surprised. It has a subtle, sweet chocolate flavor. It's a lot different in terms of flavor than any other hydration mix I've tried. The other cool thing about this hydration mix is that you can make hot chocolate with it! It's great for staying hydrated when it's cold, or after a long run in cold weather (also, it's very good when you make it with warm milk/milk substitute). I like that it contains electrolytes as well as zinc and some B vitamins. If you are bored of all the fruity hydration mix flavors, and you like chocolate, I would recommend this product.

These have made a big impact with my water intake. Normally I drink about 100 Oz of water a day, but when I drink that much water, I have to go to the restroom about every 30 min to an hour. This can be very frustrating, especially when at work. I notice that if I add this to my daily protein drinks, I definitely don’t go to the restroom as much. I really like how few calories it has.

I took the packaging's advice and mixed this with milk, and found it was a surprisingly tasty and effective pick-me-up during a cardio workout. Tasted like salty chocolate milk, which (like chocolate bars with sea salt) is actually quite delicious. Did not expect an electrolyte drink with just sodium and chloride to elevate me this much, but it did. Drinking it after pouring sweat for a bit gave me a noticeable boost I wasn't getting from a regular beverage. There are more sophisticated electrolyte mixes on the market, but this one worked very well for me.EDIT: Dunno why I thought this was just sodium and chloride. Significantly, there is also potassium, magnesium, and a number of B Vitamins. This IS a fairly sophisticated electrolyte drink.

I cannot imagine drinking this cold, but as a hydration and electrolyte supplement to my coffee pre-workout this actually tastes very good! The salt is a kick like the salted caramel coffee drinks one can get at a coffee shop, and if you are sensitive to the aftertaste of sugar-substitutes you'll still taste it.

I've tried HydroMate mixes before and they are great for feeling hydrated and replenished after an intense workout. I was really excited to try this mix because it says you can mix it with hot water and make hot chocolate with it. I used my keurig to brew 10 oz of hot water and I stirred in one packet of this afterwards. It mixes well and I love drinking it after a nighttime workout to warm up, relax and feel refreshed.

As I was drinking this I kept adding water and I enjoyed the taste even as it became more diluted. It says you can mix a packet with 8 or 16 ounces of water, and both do work for me. This dissolved in a glass of water to my satisfaction just stirring with a spoon, but a shaker jar will work as well. I feel satiated after one glass and I’m hydrated. I like the B vitamins, and vitamin C as well as the electrolytes. Only 10 calories, 2.5 g sugar and I love the flavor. Very satisfying!

The hydration plus chocolate are powder packets you add to water or milk. Liquid can be warm or cold. I added a pack of the powder to water. Takes a bit to fully dissolve by stirring. Drink tastes like thin chocolate milk. It's good.

This is kind of an odd flavor for a hydration drink, but it tastes great and chocolate lovers will really enjoy it!It's got a great chocolate taste. My only complaint is that you mix it with 8 oz of water, which is a fairly small serving if you're trying to rehydrate, but of course you can just drink water after this,

Wanting to add this to my morning routine but failed miserably. First off, I’m not a big fan of super sweet food/drinks so this is definitely not for me. You can suggest add more water then, but I did and it ends up tasting like a washed up chocolate drink. I also taste the strong salt on it so it’s like drinking a very sweet and salty drink for me. Strange flavor. The sodium content is 250mg though it’s medically considered low dose, for those who have sensitive taste buds you will definitely notice it.Also this uses sucralose as a sweetener so if you’re not a fan of it just fyi.Did it gives me the extra boost for my day? Unfortunately it gives me a headache that I have to drink tons of water to washed it down my body, half my day I have to deal with the headache and I’m not the kind who can take pain killer coz it gives me tummy ache so I just have to deal with it.

There are no redeeming qualities to this product.It doesn’t mix well in a glass, you have to put it in a bottle and shake it to get it to mix, otherwise there is a ton of floating gunk in your cup or mug. Even in a bottle it leaves these white gritty pieces (and all the chocolate gunk too).It tastes like Tootsie Roll tried to make hot chocolate powder. It kind of tastes like hot chocolate mix with that strange not-quite chocolate taste. At first, I thought it “wasn’t that bad” but then the aftertaste of salt happened. After drinking it, it leaves a gross salty chocolaty flavor in your mouth that you have to brush your teeth to be rid of.I drank a full 8 oz glass to see if it seemed to help with hydration. It made me nauseous and queasy the rest of the day.It is NOT satisfying or thirst quenching. When I finish a workout or feel thirsty, it is NOT something I want to reach for. I tried a couple times but just can’t think of any benefit of this mix.

I would argue that this is an essential purchase for just about anyone taking supplements. The convenience factor cannot be understated. I’ve used them for pre and post-workout supps for months now and they have never broken or untwisted. Cleaning is very easy as well. If I had one critique, it would be that they may be just a hair small for some protein scoops. The scoop will fit but you’ll probably miss some of the pour. This is very minor though and should NOT detour your purchase. Get a box of 5 and even if you don’t need them all, they make a great little gift for another lifter.

After using this for a bit, I was really starting to notice how heavy, hot and loud it was. Heavy is just fine when I'm polishing the top of my car, but gets a little tiring on the sides. The loud part, well, it's not exactly uniform. It sometimes whines quite badly. It made me wonder if it was about to explode several times, but it never did.I polished two crossovers and a minivan with it. I would say it was getting a bit louder by the time I finished the third vehicle. That is a concern. It's already starting to sound worn after three vehicles, so how long will it last? I guess we'll have to see. It did come with a set of extra brushes, so there's that.I used it with a variety of pads. It didn't cause me any headaches with any of them.

It's variable-speed -- sometimes a bit too variable, rising and falling even under no load -- but with plenty of torque.The drive transmission is rather loud with more gear backlash than I'd like, and the occasional bearing squeal is a bit unsettling too.  Gears are metal, the case is grease packed, but it employs a metal-to-metal cover that's going to leak -- not ideal for buffing/polishing.  It comes with an extra set of motor brushes -- puzzling to me but it's always nice to have spare parts.It has ETC and CE safety certification; there's no ground lug on the electrical cord implying double insulation.  Most of the unit is sheathed in plastic, offering some protection from dinging the work surface, but the tool quickly gets pretty heavy so care is required.  Motor ventilation area seems low for a tool drawing up to 12A -- the unit gets pretty warm in use.  The strain relief on the power cord is a loose fit, but the power cord is of good length and not too stiff.For the weekend DIY auto detailer on a budget, this is a good, basic setup.  But if you're a newbie, well, regardless of the buffer you buy, consider practicing awhile on something other than your wife's Lexus.  And wear hearing and eye protection.

Back in the day, my favorite of all time polisher was an orange Black and Decker. They stopped making that one. Currently, my favorite is a Makita with variable speeds which is more than twice the price of this one. This polisher is substantially made in that it is a bit on the heavy side which is an advantage when polishing horizontal surfaces. The weight of the machine enables you to squeeze the trigger and do nothing more than just let it dance over the surface under its own weight, when doing vertical surfaces like on the side of a car the extra weight is cumbersome, and requires a little extra effort.So, how do they make a polisher/buffer with all of these features including a digital LED lit number pad on top showing you your speed setting, as well as so many different foam pads, both a side arm, and a top hoop arm option and at such an attractive price? I'm not sure, but if I had to get critical, I would say you definitely need hearing protection when using it. The gears, and motor are unusually loud; there is even a bit of clackity-clack in the way the gears mesh. Maybe, I just got a less than perfect one, maybe not; I have no way of knowing. Since I already have the Makita that I bought several years ago, and I have an old inexpensive plug-in polisher I use for my dirtball jobs, this one will be relegated to a lender. It can be used as a sander also since it has a 7"" Velcro pad, and has several sanding discs included, but for serious grinding, your best bet is a 6,000 RPM dedicated grinding. Ideal polishing occurs at 2400 RPMs in automotive applications, and this one cover that base very well. I'm not sure the LED digit is an accurate setting representing 2400 when set to 24, for example, but that doesn't matter. When you are using compounds and polishing, the work surface will tell you exactly which speed works the best, and I am sure the digital readout would give you the same speed level again and again.Wearing ear protection is suggested when using any buffer, but I must admit this one is clearly louder than the rest I have used. It's a bargain polisher, so if you are weekend warrior, and don't want to invest in a pro-level buffer to be used on a daily basis, this could be a good choice.

MY GOD, IS THIS THING LOUD!  NOT THAT ANY ARE QUIET, BUT THIS IS ESPECIALLY LOUD, YOU WILL WANT TO WEAR EAR PROTECTION OR KEEP LOOKING FOR THE RINGING PHONE FOR HOURS AFTER USE.  ALSO NOT GREAT IF YOU HAVE INQUISITIVE NEIGHBORS THAT WANT TO CHAT WHEN THEY SEE YOU (OR HEAR YOU IN THIS CASE) DOING SOMETHING.  IT IS REMARKABLY UNNESCESARILY LOUD.That said (what?), it is heavy, so you don't have to apply pressure, but after a couple of hours of use if your ears and neighbors can stand the racket, your arms will hurt.The touch button LCD speed control is OK, but I think I prefer the older rotary style as it seems that I have more control with that style.It does heat up quickly and you can feel the heat coming off while using.  I don't like that you have to give it a break to cool down like every 20 minutes.  I tried restarting too soon once and it would not work, which makes me wonder how long it will last.The grips are an either/ or, you can't have both, I often went for a phantom handle after it was changed to see what worked best at various heights and angles.It's OK after first use, but don't know that I would buy it again.

So I got this to buff out some scratches on a display case. I’m hoping it helps and it doesn’t make things worse. It’s got a good weight on it so you will definitely have to have a good grip on it while you are using it. But I imagine it could be used for most surfaces for example like buffing out scratches on your car.

My new nickname for this YIMOOCH buffer and polisher is Buffy the Oxidation Slayer. The YIMOOCH and a little but of Meguiars One Step compound were exactly what I needed to tackle some oxidation on my old red boat - and oxidation on red is the worst.The range of speeds with the YIMOOCH really helped me dial in the right speed for the compound and later polishing. The YIMOOCH fits a wide range of 7"" polishing and buffing pads including coming with a nice starter assortment of pads. The velcro on the disc is well made and holds the pads well. I also like that it has 2 handle options for holding it.If I could change anything I would make it a little lighter weight, I don't know if that's possible for a polisher this powerful though.It's easy to use, take your time to get to know it and your car, boat, truck, RV whatever will thank you.

Someone in a parking lot scraped the side of my car.  Didn't want to claim it so I thought I would try it myself 1st.  Took a bit to get used to, but in the end with some patience I was able to buff it out enough so that you had to look to see it.  Worked much better than a pad and my battery powered drill.  This was heavy duty and solid enough to control the spin.  You just have to apply a light touch so that you don't burn the paint.

First off, this buffer has some weight to it.  If you want something light, this isn't for you.  Additionally, the ""loop"" handle and the single hand handle are either-or... or you can only use one or the other and swap them out.The buffer comes with a starter set of pads as well as sandpaper.  If you plan on using this to wax a vehicle or some other project requiring distance from the plug, make sure you have a good extension cord.  The weight can actually come in handy when buffing a vehicle and I do not find it to be too much.  Very happy with this buffer!

So this isn't going to be much of a review because I have never actually used the buffer for safety reasons.  When I got the buffer and unpacked it, I was testing the functionality of the 90 degree adjustable handle.  Id never seen that on a buffer before and was thinking ""hey I can see that being pretty handy.""  The handle was locked into the 90 degree vertical position from the manufacture.  Once I unlocked it from this position it would not lock back into that position.  In fact, the handle will only lock into the horizontal 90 where the trigger guard faces the left of the motor.  It will not lock into the horizontal 90 with the trigger guard facing the right of the motor and it will not lock back into the most needed vertical 90 position.  Since it just wouldn't be safe for me to use this buffer with the handle being able to just freely rotate, I have not used it and just dont feel comfortable writing a detailed review on something I have not fully used.The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the thing does work.  Other than that I cant review anything else about it because I am not able to use it.  So I would tell potential buyers to just spend a few extra bucks and find a better-quality buffer polisher.

This is a nice polisher - I'm hooked on car detailing videos, and I've had one of those little ""palm"" -style buffers for years, but they're a weird size and hard to find bonnets for.  I decided to upgrade to a ""real"" buffer, and this certainly fits the bill - if anything, I'm worried I might burn the paint with it, so I'm taking it slow.  I don't know how this would hold up for a full-time detailing business, but as a hobbyist it's more than enough for my needs.

I've been buying Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard whey protein powder double chocolate flavor for probably 8 years now and finally leaving a review.Pros:- Dissolves very easily in water or milk, and goes great in a smoothy too.- Doesn't have the chalky taste or texture of some other whey powders. People who complain about the flavor are being way too picky. The double chocolate is totally fine. Not as good as a real chocolate shake obviously but also not unpleasant in the least. It's protein powder...what do you expect? I haven't bothered to try any of the other flavors so I can't comment on that.- The 5 lb bucket is a great value, compromising between economy of scale and not taking up my entire kitchen cabinet.- Long shelf life.- Gainz. Obviously.Cons: None that I can think of, unless you are a vegan.

Goes further than most as serving size is smaller for same amount of protein. Powder is super smooth and dissolves more readily than most other brands. In short, it doesn’t leave clumps stuck to my cup. I use a nutri bullet to mix though shaking works quickly with my little springy mixer thing.The smoothness and mixability, combined with very low carbs wins it for me. Though, the lower carbs do result in less flavor. Otherwise, perfect.

As a fitness enthusiast and a Science guy, I am always curious to find the real value of a supplement. What works and what does not work. More importantly, I believe the analysis of a product should be based on strong scientific knowledge base, combined with good old fashion practical use of the product, and only then one should come down to the final conclusion.This product review and analysis was conducted based on 3 parametersA. Constituents: What comes in the box, the real value of the productB. Assimilation: How does this product goes down in your system, how much of it will your body assimilateC. Usability : Long term usability and and effects.I believe this is one of the best supplements available in the market today. The Question is Why?1. The Quality of protein. Since its manufactured by Glanbia (who owns Optimum nutrition), this product is coming straight from the manufacturer. This is a BIG factor, 90% of the protein supplement companies source their raw materials from third parties, often importing them from third world countries.100 grams of Whey protein isolate from one source is NOT equal to the 100 gram Whey protein isolate from another. Inferior resources usually have high level of Heavy metals and cattle Hormones. This has been elucidated from recent tests and published widely in the consumer reports. ON aced this report with minimum levels of such harmful residues. Reason is simple, they make their own whey in a plant which has to abide all regulations under US law.Just for the point of reference. I am from India, and therefore know first hand how many poorly regulated cheese plants export their whey to Europe and US. So make sure your Whey protein is coming from Whey extracted in the US!!The Additives2. Ideally, I will prefer the protein powder with no artificial sweetener. But lets face it, such a product will be hard to sell. However, Golds whey keep artificial sweeter to minimum. If you check Bodybuilding.com forums, lots of consumer complain that its not sweet enough. I request all such folks to realise that is actually good for them, if you feel this product is not sufficiently sweet for you. Its better you use lesser amount of hydrant (Milk, water, juice etc), or add a tiny bit of Honey.The Profile- The Myth about Isolate vs a Blend3. This might be hard for some people to digest. However, the truth is 96% people who use Whey supplements, will have no additional benefits of taking an Isolate vs a Blend. Please note, when I use the word blend, I mean a product lile Golds whey which is well balanced with Whey isolate and Whey Concentrate. (not any junk product form the market). If you take the blend, you might get 1 gram of extra fat or 2 grams of extra carbs which is absolutely nothing. You can burn this by adding 1.5 minute to your jog routine or walking for 2-3 minutes. You will get the same result and effect as the Isolate, so its not worth spending extra refined Isolate. The Isolate rumor is just a Hype created by the supplement industry. I will repeat this again, if your blend is as good as Golds whey i.e you are getting 24 grams per 30 gram scoop, you don't need an Isolate.Who all comprise the 4% population who can benefit from an Isolate. First people who are extremely lactose Intolerant. I have used the word extremely since all good products add enzymes to digest the little amount of lactose residue in the supplement. Lactose is not a a bad thing, its simply the milk sugar. So if you are highly allergic to Lactose, Isolate will help (they have negligible levels of lactose)Second tier of people who can benefit from Isolates are professional athletes who are pepping up for an upcoming competition. This competitive set is consuming 5-8+ scoops of Whey protein daily and therefore will benefit from reduction in additional fat or carbs.4. Why go for Whey protein blend when you have specialized protein powders with Whey,egg and Casein.Its simple science, Whey is just better with the best Biological value*. This means that your body will better absorb and use the protein source from Whey more than any other source, therefore no wastage. Egg is also a great resource, which is just behind Whey. However in real world it lags behind Whey substantially, even the delayed absorption rate cannot compensate much. Scientifically it has been proven that Whey is just better, since it doesn't tax your digestive processes as much as an egg protein.Question of Casein:Its true that Casein has an edge when it comes to delayed absorption. Its anti-catabolic properties and slow absorption makes it an ideal night time protein. This said, its best when you take Casein in concentrated from, i.e. if you need Casein, take only Caesin, do not mix it with Whey... Why do I say this, Its a big topic based on metabolism response(will add a different thread later). One last thing 24 grams of Whey protein is NOT equal to 24 grams of Casein as the Biological value of Casein is lower than Whey.However Caesin does have its own benifit of delayed response, provided you actually need it.*Biological Value: Biological value (BV) is a measure of the proportion of absorbed protein from a food which becomes incorporated into the proteins of the organism's body.Whey protein concentrate: 104Whole egg: 100Cow milk: 91Beef: 80Casein: 77Soy: 74Last Thoughts:Always keep a note of how much protein you are consuming from Supplements Vs straight from the food. Ideally one should keep protein sources from supplements under 25%, but if your life style is demanding and you are unable to get hold of good meals rich in protein, you should always keep your protein dependency under 50%. In layman terms, for most of us who are looking for fitness, keep it not more than 2 scoops/day. For those who really pump some heavy Iron keep it upto than 3 scoops/day. (let me know if you wish to know the science behind this)In the end Supplements are only Supplements. The word Supplement has a lot of Drama attached to it, as if, if you don't take a protein shake within 30 minutes of your work out.. you will never make good gain. Total Crap. This is not a make or break factor(its just beneficial). Baring few exceptions. Supplements adds up only 20 percent of your fitness equation.

This has a good chocolate flavor, but getting it to mix up is a challenge. No matter how much we would shake our mixer container, it still had large clumps of powder in it. Even using a protein drink cup with a little mixer paddle in the bottom left quite a few clumps.  I ended up having to buy a milk frother just to use to get the clumps to break up to a drinkable size.I'm not sure if it's just this batch, or what.

What’s up my Amazon Health & Fitness Family, it’s me your boy Hardbody. For those of you who have not read or seen any of my reviews, I am Certified Master Trainer for over 20 years & I have many certifications, one of which is a certification in supplementation, so because of my years of knowledge and dedication in helping people achieve healthier lives through exercise & nutrition, is the reason why I do these reviews... in hopes I can help someone, even if that is just one.• As you would guess, I use Whey Protein Isolate every single day (sometimes 2x’ per day) & this 
Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Banana Cream, 5 Pound
 is hands down the best Protein brand on planet earth. Because of that, unless I am offered to review/test a new brand, I ALWAYS buy this.• So you want to know why Whey Protein more specifically, Whey Isolate is extremely important, should you be using it &/or is this a good product? Well let me break this down a bit in hopes I can teach you something you may not have known and help you with your buying decision.————————————————————— Product Information: —————————————————————• Whey Isolate - it's important to realize that not all forms of whey protein powder are created equally. Whey protein isolate is the most complete forms of protein because it contains the greatest protein concentration coming in at 90-95%, while the rest of the whey protein powders range from 25-89% total protein content. Isolate contains the lowest level of lactose, so perfect for anyone that is lactose intolerant. Benefits of Whey Protein include: helps support a healthy immune system, supports heart health, helps with maintaining a healthy body weight & composition, promotes muscle growth, loss of body fat, reduces the risk for breast cancer in women, helps control blood glucose levels & helps prevent muscle & bone loss older adults. Whey Protein, more specifically Whey Isolate is extremely important, for those reasons. Remember that protein is the building blocks of muscle. If you are dieting or looking to bulk up, Whey protein is your best friend because it provides your body with all of the amino acids it needs to promote ideal health results from workout/training, it's low in calories, carbohydrates, fats, cholesterol & very convenient. The more protein you eat the more muscle & if you are dieting you will be able to keep more muscle.—————————---------———————————— PROS: ———-----————————————————————• Glanbia is a global nutrition company with their own farms and supplies MANY protein companies, BUT OWNS Optimum Nutrition. So why buy from a secondary source when you can buy right direct from the #1 source & that my Amazon Family makes them the best for a reason!• This is Whey Protein Blend with Isolate being more abundant.• My favorite flavor is Banana Cream & taste unbelievably good.• I always make my shakes in a blender so mixability isn’t an issue for me but I assure you that even in just a shaker cup the mixablity is phenomenal, which leads me to my next pro..• This is absolutely 100% instantized!• Has Digestive Enzymes which is extremely important for me. I have been using this for many years now & never once has my stomach been all jerked up, so another thing i can assure you is true.• This is Ultra-Filtered & any top of the line Whey would make sure the Whey is carefully micro-filtered or Ultra-Filtered to remove any harmful bacteria. The Whey will pass through a special micro-filter & immediately after, bacteria & spores are separated. This process also separates any denatured (altered/cooked) whey proteins from undenatured proteins so that the result is a high quality whey protein rich in alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin (two special proteins found in whey that have immunological benefits) and low in fat. Un-denatured whey proteins obtained in this manner also have better solubility, which means it dissolves easily in any fluid added to it.• Optimum Nutrition list down the breakdown of their entire Amino Acid profile! That my Amazon Family is excellent!• This has approximately 28g of Amino Acids which if you did not know, is a pretty healthy amount. Many won't list it because1) it is embarrassing low or2) They have something to hide.• Did I mention that this has approximately 5g of Glutamine. Many Whey Proteins do not add any.• I always buy the 5lb jug & the cost $57.99 is an exceptional price, in fact, many lessor Brands of Whey cost more!• Only 2g of sugar & 4g of carbs per scoop. Not sure where that sugar comes from because I read the “other ingredients” and don’t see it. Uses Sucralose, unless the sugar is coming from the “Natural flavor”.• 24g of protein per scoop which is more than most brands.• Has more flavors than ANY company on the planet, so you will never get bored!————————————————————— CONS: —————————————————————• NONE!!!!!!!—————————————---———————-— Final Thoughts: ——————--———————————--————• So this is the ONLY protein brand I spend my hard earned money on & will ever! This is my honest & professional review & I was not given anything in return! I paid full price for this & worth every cent!I been buying this for many many many years.—————————————---———————-— Personal Note: —————————————---———————-—• Buying a respectable brand is actually extremely important because many companies are selling a container of Whey Protein Concentrate as isolate & unless you ran a analysis on it or really know your proteins, you probably wouldn't even know you were using a cheap form of WPC until you started gaining body fat, started feeling bloated, getting gas, etc., and not getting the results you wanted from using this stuff. You would be surprised at how many companies do this! I 100% recommend

I was shocked at how gross this powder was after reading all of the great reviews. I’ve only tried the double chocolate, but it genuinely was so bad I couldn’t finish it. The only way I managed to finish this tub was by combining it with the original chocolate Slimfast powder, and it actually made the two taste exactly like a chocolate shake when blended. So, it served its purpose, it’s not a bad protein powder, but the flavor just is not good. Ordering again with a different flavor, hopefully something else tastes better.

First off, I've purchased a bunch of different flavors of ON Gold Standard Whey. All of them have close to the same nutritional value, but they vary greatly in taste. Both my wife and I drink these protein shakes as part of our daily diet, and as a product, Optimum Nutrition is great. I've mixed with both milk and water, and all of the shakes mix well and don't seem to clump. I've tried other manufactures whey, and I keep finding myself going back to ON for the price, nutritional value, and above all the taste.So the flavor question. As I mentioned, each flavor has a different characteristic from the others. Some are bland, some taste sweet, some taste overly fake. We loved some, and we hated some. Below is a list based on what we like so far and why. Bear in mind that I hate diet drinks for their bad aftertaste. The drinks don't have to be sweet for me to like them, but I can't stand the garbage aftertaste of fake sweeteners.The best flavors:Rocky Road - By far the single best tasting flavor. The downside is that it does taste a little sweet. The nutritional value is right on with the other flavors, but it is a bit sweet. I could drink this all day. If you only buy one flavor, this is it. There is no real aftertaste, and the flavor is great.Extreme Milk Chocolate - Another good flavor with almost no aftertaste. This one tastes like chocolate, and doesn't have a fake taste to it. If you are looking at the chocolate flavors, this one is perfect.Natural Vanilla - This is a slightly different product, and it comes in a tub with yellow labeling instead of the red. It's on Amazon for the same price, and it has the same nutritional values. They claim it has less artificial sweeteners in it, hence the natural label. In any case, this is the best vanilla out there. There is no aftertaste, and it tastes like vanilla milk. It is not as sweet as the others, but it the single best vanilla flavor I've found.The middle of the road flavors:Cookies and Cream - This one is both good and bad. If you like the creamy vanilla taste, you will like the flavor. It doesn't have a bad aftertaste, but it is sort bland. It is sweet, but bland. Also, the cookie chunks in it don't dissolve. This is the only flavor so far that has bits of stuff that you are swallowing when you drink it. It's odd. That said, I have reordered it in the past.Chocolate Malt - It's just OK. The flavor is a little odd because of the malt. Given the choice, just order the Extreme Milk Chocolate.Caramel Toffee Fudge - Again, just OK. They tried too hit to many flavors with this one, and it just turned out odd. Not a bad flavor, but don't start out here. I got bored so I tried it. I doubt I'll order it again.And the bad:Double Rich Chocolate - This flavor sucks. It tastes like fake chocolate. Not good fake chocolate, but generic fake chocolate. It has that bad aftertaste of fake sweetener, and is all around not good.Vanilla Ice Cream - Another swing and a miss. This flavor tastes like bad fake powdered milk. It has that bad aftertaste, and is probably the single worst flavor they have. If you are looking for vanilla, avoid this at all costs and get the Natural Vanilla.Tropical Punch - Another fake tasting flavor. When I got this, I could barely get through the first few shakes. Eventually it grew on me a little bit, and I was able to drink it without hating it. It tastes like strawberry milk with a bunch of fake sweetener. It's just wrong, and is not something you want to drink after a workout.I know that taste varies from person to person, so take this with a grain of salt. I hate the taste of fake sweetener, so this list draws from that. I've taken to buying the 2lb tubs to try out a flavor, and then going with the 5lb tubs if I like it. It costs a bit more that way, but it means there is only 2lbs to choke down if you get a flavor that you hate.Enjoy!

I’ve purchased this several times before with no issues.  The taste was OK and it blended well.This time around, the powder will not blend completely.  I typically use one scoop in a tall mug of whole milk.  I’ve tried stirring with a spoon (typical way I’ve mixed it previously) and putting a cap on the mug and shaking it, but same results.When I taste it, I can tell it’s not fully blended… I can feel the dry powder and have to swish it around my mouth before drinking it.

I have been using this powder consistently for a very very long time, however the price that it’s being sold at now just doesn’t seem to be worth it. There are other brands that will give you comparable, if not, better quality ingredients and may be formulated a little bit better. Overall the taste is decent but I believe it used to taste better with their old formula. Maybe I have grown too used to the taste and need change, but it is still very drinkable, especially if you add additional ingredients. Solid choice if you can afford it.

Unless you use a blender or shake it for a good 15 minutes it won't work too well blending wise and it has very little flavor but as long as you add some extra ingredients to it it still works well still amazing ingredient quality and good amount of protein also cheaper than buying just premade protein shakes.

Over the six months since I've been buying this product for him, he's reported an increase in muscle gains during this time compared to his previous workouts. The results actually exceeded my expectations.

But compared to the benefits of the whey protein, the flavor was more than acceptable. The quality of the ingredients is very good.

Whey vs. casein proteinby Jeff S. Volek, Ph.D., R.D.Proteins provide the body critical amino acids that serve as building blocks for the formation of new muscle. But not all dietary proteins are equal. The major proteins in milk are casein and whey. These two milk proteins are both excellent sources of all the essential amino acids, but they differ in one important aspect--whey is a fast-digesting protein and casein is a slow-digesting protein.Whey stimulates protein synthesisFast-digesting whey means it is emptied from the stomach quickly, resulting in a rapid and large increase in plasma amino acids. This translates into a quick but transient increase in protein synthesis, while protein breakdown is not affected. Whey also has higher levels of leucine, a potent amino acid that stimulates protein synthesis. Whey protein is superior at augmenting protein synthesis rapidly, but this positive effect is short-lived. Consuming repeated doses of whey allows for sustained high levels of blood amino acids and repeated bursts of protein synthesis that provide superior effects on muscle protein balance.[1]Casein offers a positive protein balanceCasein is the most abundant protein in milk. It is relatively insoluble and tends to form structures called micelles that increase solubility in water. During the processing of milk, which usually involves heat or acid, the casein peptides and micelle structure become disturbed or denatured to form simpler structures. As a result, a gelatinous material is formed. This is the basis for why casein has a slower rate of digestion, and results in a slow but steady release of amino acids into circulation.In one study, researchers gave healthy subjects 30 grams of either whey protein or casein protein and made several measures of the anabolic and catabolic effect for 7 hours after the meal.[2] Whey protein resulted in a rapid increase in blood amino acids and protein synthesis, but it was short-lived. Casein, on the other hand, resulted in a prolonged increase in blood amino acids that resulted in a 34% reduction in protein breakdown. The net protein balance remained more positive after intake of casein protein over a 7-hour period. The superior long-lasting effect of casein was attributed to a delayed gastric emptying and slower absorption rate from the gastrointestinal tract to the blood.Whey and casein are better togetherSince whey rapidly increases protein synthesis and casein blocks protein breakdown, a combination of both would be ideal.A recent study compared the effects of supplementing with either a combination whey and casein protein versus carbohydrate on several markers of muscle anabolism during strength training.3 Untrained men participated in a 10-week resistance training program and either supplemented with 40 grams of carbohydrate or 40 grams of protein containing a mixture of whey and casein. Half of the supplements were consumed one hour before and then immediately after exercise on workout days. The results were overwhelmingly positive for the combination protein group. Despite similar background diets and identical training programs, supplementation with protein resulted in greater increases in several measures of muscle anabolism, including greater increases in lean muscle mass, thigh muscle mass, muscle strength, anabolic hormones and muscle specific proteins.In a similar study that lasted 14 weeks, untrained men performed resistance training and received either 25 grams of carbohydrate or 25 grams of a combination whey and casein protein one hour before and immediately after exercise.[4] The combination protein group had significantly greater increases in muscle fiber size compared to the carbohydrate group. These studies provide strong evidence that a combination protein consumed before and after workouts increases muscle size.Practical uses of whey and caseinThe science unequivocally shows that the digesting rate of protein is an important regulator of protein balance. Whey provides a quick burst of protein synthesis while casein makes an ideal protein supplement to sustain long periods of an anabolic environment for muscle growth. Based on these different characteristics, whey and casein can be used alone and in combination to exploit their unique biologic effects.For example, whey protein can be very effective before and after a workout and first thing in the morning. But since the benefits of whey after exercise are short-lived, you should consume a meal containing protein 20-60 minutes after drinking a post-workout whey protein shake. In one study, 30 grams of whey protein were provided in a sequence of 13 small meals given each 20 minutes.[1] This was found to be far superior for muscle anabolism compared to a single meal of whey or casein.Alternatively, a combination of whey and casein (20 grams) could be consumed one hour before and immediately after exercise for a sustained benefit on protein balance. Casein is a perfect protein for a shake before bed because it promotes a sustained anti-catabolic environment while you sleep.SummaryBecause whey and casein have different but complementary effects, many people keep both types on hand and use them differently throughout the day--whey in the morning and after workouts and casein before bed. Or you can mix whey protein into a large glass of milk (about 80% casein) to combine the benefits of both. Research shows these proteins support greater increases in lean body mass and decreases in body fat as part of a resistance training program.

I’ve really enjoyed this brand , I got the vanilla cake flavor before and it was great. The strawberry banana was on sale though so I decided to give it a go. I tried it on its own with just some almond milk and that medicinal flavor was definitely there. But I typically use it to make protine shakes so I mixed Greek yogurt, almond milt, strawberry’s and banana and it tastes great! A lot like a gogert. The Greek yogurt especially takes away that gross medicine taste so if you have this give it a go !

I've used this Whey for years, on and off over the past decade. And WOW they have stepped it up. I remember first taking this and it was difficult to mix and the flavor was mediocre at best. BUT NOW, I am absolutely blown away how good this stuff tastes. I realized that I've been taking it throughout the year (2022) and it usually lasts me 2-3 months and I'd be taking it with my morning shake after workouts 4-5 times a week. I was worried that maybe I just got lucky with a flavor, I was doing a unflavored one first, then did vanilla, then I went out on a limb and tried strawberry and was worried. Wow, best decision ever. I love this product and will always be a customer.

I’ve been buying Optimum Nutrition protein powder for nearly two decades and it’s the only protein powder I trust.It’s high-quality protein that mixes easily and tastes great. When tested against numerous other protein powders, this is one of the only ones that actually had the claimed levels of protein (look up the ‘Reddit protein powder analysis’ if you’re interested in the results).The addition of BCAAs is a nice extra to have.ON 100% Whey Protein is the best protein powder out there and the only one I’ll put in my shaker. This is the stuff you want.

When I first ordered this, it was for a fitness and nutrition plan that I needed 2-3 daily protein shakes to supplement (recommended by a team athletic trainer). I was very hesitant about this because I needed to drink so much of this daily for up to six weeks straight. Fortunately, this stuff is great!Flavor is an opinion, I got the double rich chocolate and was very happy with it (happy enough to order a second jug). It dissolves completely in a shaker bottle. During the nutrition plan from our trainer, I mixed this with cold water. It was satisfying as a single serving without sitting hard on your stomach, and it kept me from getting cravings for sweets or snacks.Fast forward a couple months, and now I'm pregnant and have developed gestational diabetes. I had about 1/5 of the jug leftover, and as I've learned to control my blood sugar through diet I've discovered that this product is excellent for controlling those glucose readings, killing the random pregnancy-cravings for sweets, and most importantly, I can have a shake (made with milk, yum!) at night when I take insulin.That said, learning all this new information about diabetes, I made a mistake in timing my insulin last week. Within one hour, my blood sugar dropped over 100 points and was in the 40s, which is very dangerous. I have never experienced something like this before, so it took several minutes to figure out there was a problem with my blood sugar. I did a meter reading and an alarm preprogrammed into my meter went off. I was alone, dizzy, sweating, confused, and a little groggy but I remembered a couple things my doctor told me: drink a big glass of fruit juice, then hit the protein. I swigged back some of my kid's juice in the fridge, then turned around and sitting right there was a clean shaker bottle with a waiting scoop of double rich chocolate whey I had set up for the next morning.I was shaking so much at this point and barely conscious, I couldn't get the shaker cap on completely, but I held it on as best as I could, shook it for maybe 10 seconds, then drank it as fast as I could. No joke, I was starting to lose consciousness so I dropped everything, grabbed the phone, and went to wake up my husband. All I could get out was I needed help before hitting the floor. He immediately called the high risk OB practice I see and the on-call doctor was able to walk him through how to read my meter's logbook, how to check my levels, and told him to get me to drink juice and some form of protein.This took about ten minutes, so as I was stretched out on the floor my sugar levels started to come up enough that the fog was lifting. I told them what I'd just had to drink, so my husband read the label of the whey protein to the doctor. Her comment- ""that's perfect, I couldn't recommend anything better at this moment"". When they did the next meter reading about 15 minutes after drinking juice and protein it was already up into the 90s, and over the next hour it stabilized around 110 thanks to the protein.It's not that this stuff saved my life, it's not that it even played the biggest role in the weight loss I experienced earlier this year. That was all effort and hard work... but the outcomes in both situations were notably more positive because of this. I shared the label with my doctor during a follow-up (this product is not available in stores locally). The doctors, nurses, nutritionists, and counselors were all very impressed with the nutritional content and values. They have actually recommended two shakes for the duration of pregnancy, and if I'm diligent 24/7 with my diet and taking the insulin properly, my blood sugar has been excellent since then.I would highly recommend this to athletes, those that are looking for a way to curb cravings, add protein if it's lacking, and of course as an effective tool to cope with gestational or type 2 diabetes. The carb load per serving is well under the recommended limits on diabetic diets, and best of all this stuff isn't gross. Choose your preferred flavor (the rocky road is also good). And be kind to yourself. Learn what is healthy for you. Do not use this product without also cleaning up the rest of your nutritional needs.And keep a scoop handy!

Have purchased many times over the years, protein powder is high quality. Mixes easily, tastes great (chocolate), and provides all the nutrients needed in a whey protein powder. Unfortunately, the cost has gone up way too high (+$80 in December 2022 for a 5-pound container).If the price comes back to normal (under $50), will purchase it again.Historical price comparison for 5 lb ON Whey Chocolate or Cookies/Cream as purchased from Amazon- October 2022 = $62.99- August 2022 = $62.48- May 2020 = $49.98- September 2019 = $55.21- February 2019 = $50.01- December 2018 = $40.59

Just a heads up: If you're looking for a weight loss supplement / a meal replacer, this is NOT the product for you! This supports weight gain, look into regular protein shakes if that's what you're looking for instead.Read the side of the container as well: Settlement causes it to look like there's less in the container than there really is. Weighed the container, and I got roughly 2lbs as mentioned, despite it looking half empty.Now, onto the review itself!As other reviews were mentioning, make sure the expiration date is on the bottom and NOT the side, otherwise it's not an authentic product and will probably taste like crap. Check the ""scoops"" that come with the product too (You really have to dig around with a spoon to find it).As for mine, I received an authentic product with 0 problems.So I don't have a blender or shaker.. YET. I mixed this with a spoon, and let me tell you it worked out pretty well! It still has chunks, so if you don't have a shaker or a blender yet, definitely accept this fate lol. I'd recommend purchasing a shaker! Amazon has some that are roughly $10.I know stuff like this isn't supposed to taste too great, but WOW this surprised me. I didn't want vanilla or chocolate because I'm getting very tired of those flavors and wanted to try something new. Pick something you'll be comfortable with for about a month or two. I read another review saying it tastes exactly like a banana laffy taffy and wanted to test this, and is absolutely does. If you just chucked a bunch of banana laffy taffies and blended them in milk, that's exactly what it tastes like.So that being said, it's a VERY strong artificial banana flavor, mildly sweet- but not overwhelmingly sweet. Genuinely, you can't even tell this is a protein supplement, and that's all I care about.I will be buying more of these in the future and trying out the other flavors, but overall I'd give this a solid 7/10. I'm not a banana guy myself, so I wasn't expecting to love this at the start.Blew my expectations though. I'd love to try the cookies and cream one some day.

I will continue to buy this flavor because I can’t find anything else that is as satisfying in my coffee.

Flavors are good and I love using this brand to build some gains.Every other day I'll have a shake with Almond milk to switch up the consistency to make it easier for me to enjoy consistently. Otherwise, the shake is perfect with just a cold bottle of water 8oz.

This is the only protein powder I've ever had that's just mixed into the water effortlessly.  There's no clumps or anything to swallow down, making it a smooth drinking experience.  Furthermore the price is actually very fair.  The taste is nice, thought I would say there's nothing that really yells rocky road since the chocolate flavoring in it is overpowering anything else they may have put in it.  Would buy again.

The only problem here is that the container is only half full it’s a huge container as you can see you only get half the mix in it there’s a certain amount of scoops in it but I use two scoops. I love the protein I love the flavor it’s got a little bite of coffee plus the wonderful chocolate and the chocolate is not over done. I have been on way for probably the last 10 years I had a lot of digestive issues and it really clears things up. It helps with my colon health and it digest easily. The problem is I wish they were stopped con us and give us the size the size of this container is huge to mail out the process and then again to recycle. There’s no need for this large container. Other than that this stuff really works. I used to buy da Vinci way but it got to where it was 70 or $80 for a very small container. This is good for the money I just had some this morning it’s Saturday morning and I feel fantastic. It really is a good value you can mix it with almost anything I can shake it up in a small shaker and it mixes very well. I really like it this is not a paid advertisement I receive no money from the company but I think I will continue to buy it. I’ve tried many other formulas this one seems to be about the best I bought the huge  bucket which is about $79 or 69 whatever the shipping is. But it is a good value and basically if I had this at the LA fitness Center it’s called med nutrition Center, I would probably pay about 7 to 8 dollars for 28 ounces which is still good but they make it with way  milk almond milk and I can’t even digest that anymore because of the sugar I’m not diabetic I’m very healthy and this stuff keeps me healthy. So try it out and of course if you don’t like it you can always resend it to Amazon I’ve had very good luck with Amazon products.  I am a nutritionist I am a certified Court Mediator which makes me neutral and I was training hi Harvard MindBodyMedicine which is mindfulness-based stress reduction and this really helps with my stress because it doesn’t bind up my colon. I really really enjoyed it. Try it and see if you like it because it’s all up to individual taste #Neuroguru

Overall great quality, my only real complaint is that I wish they had a neutral or unflavored version because for at least the French Vanilla the flavor has a really off-putting artificial flavor aftertaste. Easy fix is to just mix it with something else though so not much of a negative overall, hence 4 stars instead of 5.

Read tagline….then blend with compatibly flavored creamer….then poor into coffeeOR….blend into milk….poor over cerealNeither my fitness level nor overall goals warrant “mass gainer” grade carbs be involved, however they DO call for a more balanced option than most protein supplements are able to offer….so I create my own balance.I do drink this one on its own with water at other points in the day, but it is a little light on flavor. But it blends EXCELLENTLY so I use a small amount of water to concentrate, down it quick, and then just have muggle water for the rest of the hydration.

I am usually happy with a protein powder if it tastes good and mixes well, and this is great on both counts.  I use protein powders because I am eating at a calorie deficit to lose weight, plus I am a vegetarian and don't really care for most protein-heavy foods (too many eggs just don't agree with my stomach, nuts and butters are super high in calories although I do eat some of those, etc.).  That puts me at huge risk to lose muscle mass, which I don't want to do.  One way to overcome this problem, or at least basically keep up (maybe not gaining, but certainly not losing muscle), is to consume additional protein.I have found one good way to get protein is to make a smoothie in the morning.  I take 8 oz of unsweetened almond milk, plus ground flax seed (or sometimes hemp seeds or chia seeds, depending on what is in the pantry), some type of greens powder or moringa, matcha, PB2, cacao, and protein powder and blend it all together.  Then I add a half cup of frozen mixed berries.  That way I am getting a lot of protein and antioxidants all at once, without too much sugar, but the chocolate/peanut butter/berry taste seems quite decadent.  This is the protein powder I have been using lately and it is one of the best I've tried.  It has a great chocolate taste (this is a review for the double rich chocolate flavor, by the way), and it is such a fine powder, it is easy to measure out and it mixes perfectly without clumps.  (I do use an immersion blender to mix.  I find mechanical means better for such things and it is easier to clean than a standard blender.)I love that this is supplemented with BCAAs.  I have recently become a big fan of BCAAs.  They work so well for me in reducing delayed onset muscle soreness, and I have been lifting heavy (for me) weights lately in an attempt to preserve muscle.  So I have experienced a lot of delayed onset muscle soreness, but I feel that the BCAAs are doing a good job of helping repair my muscles and ease the soreness.  That is a nice plus from this product. Plus, vegetarian diets may be low in BCAAs (although some are found in dairy and eggs).I also like the macronutrient balance here.  This is pretty low in fat and carbohydrates.  Although I am not strictly tracking macros, it is nice to find a protein source that is pretty much just protein and not much else -- I get plenty of fiber in my diet already from fruits, vegetables, beans, and grains, plus that way I can get my fat somewhere else (since fat does taste quite good!), like in using actual butter or olive oil to roast vegetables (instead of cooking spray) or maybe having a little real peanut butter instead of just PB2, having an avocado on taco night, etc.I do like that this is made in the US.  I feel there are better quality controls in the manufacturing process.  Plus, you know, I only feed my pets food and treats made in the US, and I should have standards at least as good for myself!In the end, I highly recommend the double rich chocolate flavor, in particular, as a palatable, easily mixable, nutrient-balanced vegetarian protein formulation.  Once I make it through all the protein powder samples I have accumulated, this is a top contender for a repurchase.

This is a great protein powder all around, but so far chocolate is by far the superior flavor and texture wise.. it does have a couple extra grams of carbs and sugars per serving compared to some more expensive brands, but it also is at the top of the list with amount of protein, vitamins, aminoacids per serving for almost half their cost. As I said I've tried a few flavors (chocolate, vanilla, cookies and cream). Chocolate was by far the best. It really was like a chocolate shake, got to a nice smooth consistency. The others were lacking flavor - more chalky, vitamin milky water with an artificial sugar aftertaste.. that also makes the chocolate great for blending up some greens and stuff as well.

Because it is chocolate, I expected this product to taste better, but it tastes bitter to me. Someone told me that instead of using creamer, I should put some of this into my coffee for weight loss. Perhaps it does help because my weight is down, however, I will NOT purchase this product again because, unknown to me before, it's extremely high in cholesterol. To cut down on the cholesterol and make it last longer, I'm using about 1/3 of a scoop instead of a whole scoop.

Really 2.5 for me, I gave it the extra half star since I am rating it on the following which is subjective at best.  I have been using this protein drink (Chocolate) for years, and I was happy with it.  I gave it a 4.5 out of 5.  It tasted good, mixed well, and had a good consistency.  This is based on using it with a blender only, with a ""thick shake"" setting.  Recently, something changed.  The price increased by about 10% to 20% and the amount decreased by about 10%, from 2lbs to 1.78lbs.  This annoyed me, but was not enough to give it up.  I understand that things go up sometimes, not enough to change my rating, so I re-ordered.  When I tasted it I realized something had really changed.  The taste was… different, and not in a good way.  It's hard to describe, but it tasted ""artificial,"" definitely not what I was used to.  The taste was strange; previously it tasted like a milk shake, I could not tell that there was anything artificial in it.  But now… it was not good.  It was tolerable, I have tasted worse protein drinks, but it definitely was not what I was used to from this brand.  I then compared labels from the old to the new.  The only difference was at the end of the ingredients it listed an ""immune support blend"" of C, D and Zinc.  I don't see how this alone could change the taste so much, but something did.  I used to alternate between this and the ""Naked Whey"" brand, since the ""Naked Whey"" was a lot more expensive and it did not taste as good, .but was all natural.  Unfortunately, the taste in the new version is bad enough for me to give it up completely.

This stuff is made from a milk byproduct. The prices of whey is beyond ridiculous! This product, I believe, gives you the most bang for your money. The banana creme isn't bad either. I still would compare like crazy before you spend you hard earned money. I tend to favor this brand. Those fancy whey powders and big companies are way overpriced! I care nothing about the ""reasons"" they give. I use this to help out with my protein intake not as a meal replacement. Plus, your body only absorbs protein at a slow rate, so excess protein is wasted.

I bought both the Vanilla and Chocolate  Flavors on prime day since this was on sale so I thought I’d give this protein powder a try.  I’m always down to trying one’s I’ve never had before and this one is mostly good but it does have its problems. The taste is definitely amazing it says vanilla but when you first open it up you smell cake batter instead and that’s what it tastes like but it’s not as sweet as some are saying. Also I use a 16 oz shaker and use water never milk. The shaker works wonders it helps break all the clumps from the tub. Because that’s exactly what the powder looks like instead of your normal protein powder that looks smooth and already refined in a tub. Another positive is the amount they have in the 2lb tub it’s a lot more servings than the optimum gold standard 2 lb tub. Also one more thing it says to use two scoops for 14-16 ozs do NOT use two scoops because the scooper is massive just for one scoop that should be enough you shouldn’t need two scoops of this. (This is just from Vanilla I haven’t tried the chocolate I’ll give an update on that flavor soon enough) Overall I’d say give this a try if you’re new to using protein powders or just wanna try something different than your usual protein powder you use.

This chocolate peanut butter protein is some of the best tasting protein I’ve had. I’ve used this many times; large and small jug.That being said, there’s only one issue I have with it. The smaller jug has a super flimsy lid. It will appear like it closes correctly, however if you squeeze the sides of the lid it will pop off. So, if you pick it up by the top, the jug will let loose and tumble to the ground sending powder everywhere. Happened to me twice with two different jugs. Only got to enjoy half of the bottle as the other half was blanketing the kitchen floor like a fresh, brown snowstorm. The large jug does not have this lid problem from what I’ve experienced.In conclusion, the protein is excellent but beware of the lid of the smaller container.

I find adding a half scoop to my high protein yogurt adds 15 grams protein. Strongly advise users to chew a papaya enzyme with use of this and all Whey based protein powders. It aids in digesting the amino acids. Most high cost whey proteins have in as ingredient but cost double. Body fortress prices nearly all amino chain acids as this boutique brands costing two or three times cost. But papaya enzymes are cheap 180 tabs for as low as $5.Most people don’t digest majority of the proteins they supplement. Undigested proteins  pass  through with no results.Papain is the best digestive aid. Fresh fruits high in papain can and should be blended for shake drinkers. If fine you get full digestion of chain amino acidsBe wellBut I save money with this great product.

I've tried a wide variety of protein powders and this one is one of the better ones that I've had. Great amount of protein and amino acid content especially for the price. If you're looking for a good taste this one has it.The only problem I had with it was the solubility of it in water. If you try to stir this in a cup you're not gonna have good results. Even when I used my blender bottle it still had a graininess to its texture and I had to use my high power blender to completely mix it.Once I used my blender though all the problems went away and it went down nice and smooth with a superb flavor and was a great drink to have after my workout.

I've seen reviews claiming these have deceitful nutritional fact. Mostly in terms of the actual amount of protein per scoop. I'm here to tell you, I can't confirm that because I don't know how to, and more importantly, I don't really care. As long as it's not unhealthy for me, it's fine.Now, to the review(s). I've tried Strawberry, Bananas & Cream, and Cookies &Cream. They all blend the same in my shaker bottle. No protein clusters of chunks floating around. They get very frothy, though. And if you're a fan of whole milk, these are REALLY good with that. Almond Milk is just as good, it just makes them thicker in consistency, so you get more of a milkshake texture. I haven't tried water because I will never mix protein powder with water. Ever. Yuck. I hate it. Plus with milk/almond milk you get that extra 3-5g protein.Cookies & Cream is my absolute favorite. It takes just like a milkshake. Seriously. It's delicious. I can go on for days about this one. My goodness!Bananas & Cream is just the same. Very potent with the banana flavor. It seems slightly thicker than Strawberry and Cookies & Cream, but that could just be me. The flavor is the bomb, though. I love it.Strawberry is strawberry. And honestly, that's all I can ask for. It tastes like strawberry. And if you've had any other brand's version, you'd appreciate this review. Strawberry tastes like strawberry. Not Nyquil. That's all I'll say on that.Strawberry Banana. I mix these two occasionally. One scoop of each, because I love strawberry banana flavored things. As and I love the taste of these two combined.This also mixes very well with oatmeal. I use about half a scoop in plain oatmeal, cook with almond milk and a few walnuts. It's amazing. I never have to add anything else, except maybe butter.Overall, I love this stuff!

I have been using the for about two months I don't really need artificial protien to hit my protien intake for each day. However it does help with bulking because sometimes I need an extra 300 calories. If you do buy this just know you need to drink a lot of water. I personally drink about a gallon a day, and it seems to be fine with me. So no uncomfortable trips to the restroom if do drink the correct amount of water for you. Just remember any type of protein powder is rough on your kidneys so don't use this in an excessive amount. 1 scoop 30 grams of protein max it out at 2 and it's 60 grams

I knew I had to change something in my nutrition habits, not saying anything it's really wrong with me. Also, since my sister drinks protein shakes, I asked her for a reference. Once I found out she drinks Whey Protein, she recommended it to me as my doctor said the same thing. Starting a routine, I drink Whey Protein three times a week for starters. I have a ways to go and to get comfortable as the powder has to get used to my body/system.I got the vanilla flavor because it's a neutral flavor and I can blend it with peanut butter or frozen fruit if I choose. Mixing the powder is fairly easy; just remember to have a blender or shaker cup for the best results. If you have neither, mixing the powder with your favorite drink (milk for example) is also an option but may not taste the same as with a shaker cup for example.As there were many choices for Whey Protein, I'm glad I choose the best option for me as I'm looking for a simple protein boost. Afterward, I usually do a form of exercise for 15 minutes or so. As I mentioned, once the powder gets comfortable with me, I can always adjust or tweak a few simple changes to how I consume it.

Background: I’ve been lifting weights for pleasure for 20 years. I’ve used creatine and vegan powders, but it’s my first whey protein. After using this for a week, I’m pleased with the results. I’m a small woman who loves lifting weights, so I only drink one scoop on water or milk after my workout.Digestion: I have a sensitive stomach , usually avoid sweeteners, coffee, lots of flours, etc. I still get to drink this whey protein without issues. I also listen to my body: if my stomach is not up for it, I only drink half of the massive spoon and leave the rest for later.Flavor: Banana flavor is Not bad at all, actually kind of enjoyable with milk, even with the sweetener.Results: It makes me feel full and I’m noticing that lifting more, eating more protein, and adding this has made the whole process easier and I’m getting bulkier ( more muscle ).I deduct a star because I wish it didn’t have artificial sweeteners in it , but I knew it when I bought it.I have no idea if it’s spiked , if it has all the protein it claims to have or not. I’m just happy that I can keep it down and it seems to be helping my weight training goals. I would try to find something healthier in the future, but this is a good kickstart for me to get past the plateau where I was.I the Creatine of the same brand before my workout , less than a spoon. I don’t mind if the whey only has 1.5 g per spoon. I’m already taking creatine and  I don’t need that much more for my size, so a gram is perfect for me. Then I drink the whey post workout or a little earlier in the day to supplement a meal.For $17 for 2 lbs, it’s a good value, and will buy again next month.

There is nothing we dislike about the vanilla flavor powder. We feel it is a good match for our needs.Yet, we are no longer able to in the 4 -5 pound container that we come to enjoy. Now we search to get a 2 pound container. Plus 2 of these containers are more expensive than 1 of the 4 pound. Is this Body Fortress way of making money and passing the burden on to the customer at the same time?My simple request once again, is come back with the 4 -5 lb vanilla container.

Cookies and cream is delicious! I did notice the slight diet aftertaste that other reviews complained about,  but it's not too bad and you get used to it.  I'm no doctor or scientist, but I would think natural sugar would be healthier than an artificial sweetener that's made in a chemistry lab. My review would be 5 stars if they went back to the original flavor.  But it's still delicious,  I look forward to it every day.I mix 1 scoop with 12oz of skim milk in a Blender Bottle with a whisk ball inside ($5.99 @ Tj Max) and it's perfect and about 42g of protein (30g scoop + 12g milk).I highly recommend this.

I don't like the fact that it has to be consumed within 10 minutes of mixing it because drinking it so fast always makes me feel more than a little sick. The fact that they use artificial sweeteners means that you're not digesting it and it just rapidly creates bacteria that makes you sick if you drink a lot of it at a time. (More of the sweetener in your body all at once=more bacteria.) I've tried sipping but I'm just not that patient and artificial sweeteners aren't good for you, anyway. I'll be looking for products that either use Stevia or nothing from now on.That being said, the flavor is one of the better ones though still chalky. I think the quality is good. I work out 2.5x a day 6 days a week including weightlifting (total of about an hour and thirty minutes a day incl. dynamic warm-ups and static stretching cooldown times which do a lot of the anti-soreness work), drink a serving of BCAA's at my first workout and I don't have a lot of muscle soreness if any, though I still feel fairly exhausted by Saturday.The scoops are huge so it doesn't last long. I didn't factor in the servings per container when looking at this. If you were to take 2 scoops every time it would only last 9 days. As I stated, I work out twice a day every day except Saturday so that means I've run through this container really fast and will probably need to order another one in less than a week from now. I'm thankful it's cheap or I'd have given up on buying protein powders all together.It's rather a lot of calories totaling up to nearly an entire meals worth at 2 scoops but I don't eat much, anyway, so this helps me not be too far under my calorie goal in the event that I don't consume enough for any reason.The one thing I will say is that the Cinnamon Swirl one is horrible. The taste is bland and it doesn't seem to have anti caking agents so not only can you not scoop it properly and there's always a massive empty hole at the bottom that you can't fill but it doesn't even mix. You end up just chewing on clumps of the powder it's disgusting. I've even tried doing it with boiling water/milk, hoping the heat would help dissolve it. It helped a little bit, but stopped working after a bit. I'll only eat it in my hot cereals, now, since you won't really be able to tell that way and I can add extra flavorings to it to make it taste better. But I won't be buying another one.

Insofar as protein powders are helpful, this is a good one. I'm not a nutritionist, but I suspect that the ""real"" advantage of these products is they force you to drink more water after your workout than you would otherwise. That said, I like the chocolate/peanut butter flavor of this--it's pretty good by itself, and in comparison to most supplement powders of all brands, it's outstanding. Price varies a lot by store and over time. $14-16 should do it.

I fell in love with Beachbody's Recover drink (chocolate) but realized I could get the same benefit out of a regular protein shake instead of spending $80 a tub for 20-something servings. I have tried quite a few different brands and flavors to get something that tastes even remotely as good as the Recover does. The extreme milk chocolate flavor is good even mixed with water. I will add a little bit of cocoa powder or PB Fit to give it a little extra something. Recover still hands down tastes better but for the price difference this stuff will work just fine! The vanilla ice cream flavor is also delicious.

This review will be on three different flavors. Tropical Punch, Extreme Milk Chocolate, and Vanilla Ice Cream.First, I am not a gym rat or anything like that. Like many people after the new year, I decided I wanted to lose weight, but this time I actually started working out. lol. I know that protein is a great thing to have especially after a workout. I have tried Whey Protein in the past and it always tasted absolutely gross. I was shocked beyond belief when I received my first Whey Protein order of Extreme Milk Chocolate and how good it tasted. That's when I bought the Vanilla Ice Cream and then the Tropical Punch and I have placed an order for the Mocha Cappuccino. The previous protein powders that I did not like were not Optimum Nutrition if I remember correctly.I titled this Tropical Punch because I had a heck of a time finding reviews on that particular flavor.I make my mixes 8oz plus one scoop of powder. You'll understand this later. I also use one of those hand shaker blenders (I think that is right).TROPICAL PUNCH - After reading some of the reviews, I opted to try this with Gatorade (or maybe it was Powerade) first because many people said that this tasted nasty with milk. I have not tried it with milk and I don't plan to after trying it with the Gatorade and Powerade (both were fruit punch and I also tried it with the White Cherry Powerade). It tastes pretty good to me, but it doesn't taste like tropical punch or at least not any tropical punch I have ever had. I use 4 - 6 oz of either sports drink and the rest water to make 8 oz. Thus far, I have one of these after a cardio workout. I know that these sports drink have a lot of sugar (21g per serving) but that is for a serving size of 12 fl. oz. Basically, 7 - 14g of sugar is a heck of a lot better than downing a 12oz can of soda (I had a ""discussion"" with a friend and needed to vent that line. lol)VANILLA ICE CREAM - This also taste pretty good to me. It taste like it says. I mix this with 4 - 8oz of 2% milk (sorry fitness extremist, but skim milk is just not that great tasting to me and yes I have tried it with skim and 1%). Of course, if you use 4 oz of milk then use 4 oz more of water to make the drink.EXTREME CHOCOLATE MILK - I saved the best for last, for the ones I have tried. I love, let me repeat this, love this powder and I never thought that chocolate would be my favorite flavor (I'm one of the odd people that prefer vanilla over chocolate). If you want to try one Whey Protein to see what it is like, then you have to get this one in a 2lb jug to see if you like it. Since I'm not the only one using this powder, my first one (purchased about 3 weeks ago) is almost gone and I just ordered a 5lb jug of this because it is that awesome. I mix either soymilk (If you told me ten years ago that I would enjoy a chocolate flavored soymilk, I would have cried laughing over the improbability) or my 2% milk 4 - 8oz. When I mix this with the 2% milk, it tastes almost identical to Barber's Tru Moo Chocolate Milk. When I mix it with the soymilk, it tastes a bit off from the ""Tru Moo"" like chocolate milk, but not comparing it to that, it taste really good.I will add more when I get more flavors. I hope this helps people decide on this product.

I have tried many types of protein, including vegan (super yuck). I'm sure there are comparable products to this one, but I have had good results using Gold Standard Whey. I have only had the chocolate flavors and they are very tasty. Adding a banana, strawberries etc only enhances the flavor. It's, at the very least, a good place to start. You may not have to go to another product after trying it, though.

Tastes great! A lot of people have issues with the taste of other protein powder (me included) but this was VERY surprising with how smooth and yummy it is! I don't even have an issue with using water with it when push comes to shove, and considering I'm lactose intolerant, it didn't leave me with any digestive issues or tummy aches afterwards, and it's been a few weeks since I've been taking it.

The Extreme Milk Chocolate tastes terrific.  The Unflavored doesn’t have much effect on the taste of milk, so I use it on cereal.I’m one of the older rats in the barn.  I turned 70 a few months ago.  I have been working out off and on forever.  When I was younger, I was trying to be slender, not scrawny.  As I got older, I became more concerned with slowing the aging process.  Recently I ran across articles in several reputable sources observing that older people need more protein than younger, so I thought I’d give the whey a try.  The results have been extraordinary.  I’ve plateaued at 21 pushups for years.  I just did 26.  Since I started going to this particular gym about 10 years ago, I have occasionally managed seven pullups.  I just did nine.  Keep in mind that there are no secret minerals in the whey.  What I am is a guy with a not atypical omnivorous diet who was probably getting at the low end of the protein recommendation for younger men of his weight.  This was fine for getting me through the day.  But apparently, I wasn’t getting enough protein to take full advantage of my workouts.

Guess what everybody...this product is great. I go through phases where I have one protein shake every day, and this is the best one I've tried. It's great by itself, but I often add in some instant coffee. I think this powder would work well with a regular diet, but I personally like it when I'm trying to do keto or just reduce my carb intake.Remember: liquid first, then add powder. I recommend blending in half of the scoop first, then once that has blended, mix in the other half. It blends more smoothly that way for me.Looking at the negative reviews - I didn't have any issues with a ""gnarly chemical smell,"" and I've never had to contact the company, so I can't speak to those criticisms. I started buying this during the pandemic, so I'm not sure if the formulation I've had tastes different than some of the older reviews. I never had any gastrointestinal issues with this product, either.I just use hot water, personally. The taste is still good without adding milk. If I want a bit extra taste, I'll add 2 oz heavy cream at the end. Well, that or heavy whipping cream, which I learned is a different thing from just regular ""heavy cream."" Who knew? I didn't. Don't judge me. We all start somewhere. My knowledge base for creams (and many dairy products, generally) is just lacking for whatever reason. Maybe it's a failure of the education system. Maybe I'm genetically predisposed to not retain information regarding different types of creams. It's not like I'm over here confusing dairy products for facial creams or something like that (I'm not a total ""Lost Cause""), but still. I'm going to have to go down to the city library and see if there are any good sources of literature on this issue, but to be honest I'm not 100% certain that it is a good/efficient use of my time.Anyways, my partner likes to make hers in a regular blender with just milk and a handful of frozen fruit.

I tried both the extreme milk chocolate and the vanilla ice cream flavors. I tried to convince myself that I didn't hate the vanilla for so long, but I am at the point where I can no longer tolerate it. The vanilla completely overpowers literally everything you put it in with this strange, cloying flavor. I tried smoothies, oats, pancakes, desserts...everything I could think of. The only thing I can do with the vanilla is make oats, and that's if I use some other flavors that actually drown out the strange ""vanilla"" flavor. Other than that I am at the point where I am just trying to gag it down to finish it off. The extreme milk chocolate is simply okay, but it's much better than the vanilla. It tastes more like a packet of cheap hot cocoa mix, which is fine; it's not really ""chocolatey"" to me. However, neither of these powders mix well with hot liquids (like coffee). That is a mistake that I made several times while trying to finish them off. They dissolve okay in cold liquids. Overall, I would never order the vanilla again (do not make the mistake that I did!), and I am on the hunt for a better chocolate protein powder from elsewhere.

I used to drink protein shakes all the time when I was in college and heavily working out but I was drinking my bf’s. So when we broke up I was too cheap to buy my own and the ones I did buy tasted like crap or wouldn’t mix well. Now I’m trying to up my protein game and decided to try this and I’m sooo glad I did!! I got the Extreme chocolate and I’ve just been mixing it with water in an $8 shaker and it mixes up so quick and the texture and taste is ENJOYABLE.

Review based on Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor.There's a reason they call this ""Gold Standard."" Each scoop packs in 24 g of high quality whey isolates, aka the pure protein good stuff, with only 130 calories and 1.5g Fat per scoop. Whey is a short acting protein, so it's best taken shortly after a lift session. This review is based on the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor. While it doesn't taste as good as something like Muscle Milk, I didn't expect it to, since it cuts out a ton of the sweeteners and calories found in Muscle Milk. With 8 oz of water, one scoop of this stuff creates a mild, odd chocolate flavor. I wouldn't say it's bad, but I wouldn't say it's good either. With 8 oz of skim milk, the flavor improves a great deal, and is borderline ""tasty."" With milk, it also creates a much thicker drink of a milkshake like consistency. I will definitely stick to drinking this with milk from now on. If the taste was a little better, I would have given this 5 stars.As a medical student, I know that a lot of these protein supplements are not only unnecessary, but can be dangerous. Excess protein won't help you build muscle any faster. It has the potential to clog up your kidneys and lead to kidney damage at a young age. I spoke with several doctors I've worked with in the hospitals during my rotations and here's the consensus: 1) Keep well hydrated. The more dehydrated you are, the more likely the excess protein will damage your kidneys. 2) Don't over do it. The average person only needs about 1 g of protein per kg body weight. If you're exercising a lot (especially lifting), your protein needs certainly increase, but only to about 1.2 - 1.8 g protein per kg body weight. The average person gets plenty of protein in their everyday diet, so adding a supplement isn't necessary for the vast majority of people. Studies have shown that most people DON'T benefit (ie. gain any more muscle) from adding them to their workout. Here's the thing: If you're dieting, you may be losing some of the normal protein sources in your diet, and therefore, could benefit from some form of protein supplement. That is where I fall in. I am currently trying to shed some pounds with dieting and exercise, while trying to not only maintain, but build some lean muscle. So for me, I think the supplements will be beneficial.Summary and advice: This is a great choice for protein supplementation, especially for those on a diet, due to the high percentage of protein per scoop, with low calorie/low fat profile.

I was a previously a user of the Muscle Milk Chocolate - Collegiate Series but for some reason they stopped making it!  I tried other chocolate flavors but I hated the taste of them.  My friend recommended trying Whey Protein as it was better so I thought I would give this a shot and I love it! The taste is way better as I drink this with 2% milk.

This is a supplement. It is not to be your sole source of protein. Also, based on your level of activity, the more muscle you break down, the more protein you need to consume. When done properly, this gets it done.

3.5/5I bought this shake to increase my protein intake while reducing carbs and fats in order to grow lean muscle mass.  My first experience was awful.  I had the first serving after getting home from work, had it in water.  It mixed relatively well, no big clumps but you could see the powder in the liquid, it would have probably settled after a while.  I started drinking it; first, I didn't like the smell, second, the texture is awful, you kind of feel the powder in the water.  The aftertaste was good, but drinking it was a bad experience.  Later that night at the gym I had to run to the bathroom, it totally messed up my stomach.  Also, my tongue and palate felt like If I had burned drinking a very hot beverage.  I thought this was something else until I noticed it felt like that after drinking the shake, every time.  Second time I had it in water it didn't mess up my stomach, but had the same trouble drinking it. The only problem I have is that milk has fat and carbs, which is what I'm trying to avoid.Now, later that week I decided to give it a try in milk.  What a difference! It's blissfully good! Creamy, chocolaty, dissolves well, no strong smell, didn't mess up my stomach!  As good as any chocolate milk!  I did feel the burnt sensation on my tongue and palate.So, in summary: good in milk, bad in water.  Weird sensation in tongue and palate after drinking, which goes away soon.  Drink plenty of water afterwards.I'll update soon with details about performance.Update: Using a shaker bottle helps a lot when mixed in water. Texture is improved and is easier to drink.  After this I believe it is deserving of the full 4 stars.  Hopefully performance will make me change it to 5.

I'm going to review this product base on: flavor, solubility, and effectiveness.Flavor:I've never heard of milk chocolate (as a drink) before, and maybe it doesn't really exist outside of this product, but this product does not taste like chocolate milk. Before purchasing ON's Whey Gold Standard, I discuss the option of flavors with my friend. My first choice was the Double Rich Chocolate, who can go wrong with chocolate? But he mentioned that it might be too chocolatey for me. So then I saw the Extreme Milk Chocolate (EMC) and thought that it was a perfect solution; it is chocolate, but not super chocolate.Perhaps this is my own fault for not reading the flavor correctly, but I thought milk chocolate was the same as chocolate milk. I mix the powder with milk (I don't think any whey powder taste good mixed with water), and it makes a nasty sewage color solution. It taste as good as it looks.I think the flavor is milk (like powder milk), or vanilla powder, and chocolate. So when it is mixed with milk you obtain milk, milk, milk, milk, chocolate. I think the ratio of milk powder is a lot more than the chocolate. I have tried using less milk and more powder to see if it changes the flavor, but it does not.As far as taste goes, I would not buy the Extreme Milk Chocolate, maybe try the Double Rich Chocolate. I purchased the 
Optimum Nutrition 100% Casein Protein, Chocolate Supreme  2 Pound
 and it taste a lot better than the EMC, so that is my reasoning for possibly buying the DRC.Solubility:To mix the whey I use the 
Sundesa BB28-MC01 BlenderBottle 28-Ounce with BlenderBall, Blue
, and it works pretty well. The blender bottle works wonderfully (I've written a review for that too), but this powder does not dissolve well, maybe 90% of it dissolves completely. No, its not user error. When I use the blender bottle to mix the Casein protein, all the powder dissolves. It could be that particular flavor, I cannot say for sure until I try another one.The one issue with this powder is that it generates a lot of gas when it is mixed using blender bottle. After shaking, the liquid produces a lot of bubbles, it can be rectified by swirling the bottle, but the gases still form. So a few hours after drinking it, I get really gassy. Maybe it's my body's reaction to this type of powder, I have never experienced this with any Muscle Milk powders. ON's casein powder also produces gas, but not to the same degree, and it doesn't cause me to become gassy.Again, maybe it's just happens with this flavor, I won't known until I try the Double Rich Chocolate. The only reason this brand is still redeemable in my eyes is their casein powder. I'm pretty much blaming everything on the EMC flavor.Effectiveness:This one is going to be short, I promise. I'm sure you already know the benefits of whey protein, otherwise you would not have search for this product in the first place. There are plenty of sites that can give you information about whey protein for workouts, and most of them say that the majority of whey proteins are the same, the main difference is flavor, hence the reason my review is mostly based on flavor.I gave it three stars because of the flavor (-1 stars) and gassy side effects (-1 stars).

Preface: I bought this specific powder because according to the ""Big Reddit Protein Powder Measurement Results"" (Google it!) spreadsheet, it has the one of the closest claimed protein percentages vs actual tested protein percentages. In other words, I figured I can trust it.I am unsure about the results as I am only a few months into my new diet and I have yet to begin my proper workout routine. As such, this will be subjective on the taste and consistency.Taste: a bit too sweet, and definitely gross with water. However, it tastes okay with whole milk and actually a little like someone took Swiss Miss and added a bunch of sugar to it, along with a spoonful of some mostly-tasteless substance that thickens everything a bit.Mixing: it does dissolve pretty well, but not as well as might be implied by packaging. Mixing it is actually very similar to trying to mix Swiss Miss cold: it clumps a bunch and sticks to the spoon. You'll have better results using a mixer or shaker. HOWEVER, it is totally drinkable mixed with just a spoon or fork in a glass.My tip for people who are new to protein shakes and find the regular mixture hard to swallow/gross: use a full serving (1 rounded scoop) with about 6 ounces of whole milk. If you don't have a mixer/shaker, stir it well with a spoon, but then let it sit for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, and smashing any large clumps on the side of the glass. Then close your eyes and chug it. Think of it like a medicine, not a meal.

Sometimes you have to convince yourself the chalky fake flavored protein powder you're consuming is good, but i genuinely enjoy this more than any other brand/flavor.

It tastes a lot better than most proteins. It’s very smooth and the thing I love most of all is the fact it doesn’t clump up like other protein shakes. The powder isn’t really hydrophobic so it soaks in well. I recommend putting it in a blender with chia seeds milk and some ice tastes great.

I've only tried a handful of Whey Supplement products, fairly new to trying to put on weight when I work out. I can say without a doubt this is the best one I have tasted. It mixes well with water, has a pretty thin texture (as opposed to some like GAT which still taste decent but have a thicker texture to it) and all the flavors I have had from them have been delicious. My only complaint would be that I do often try to mix it with milk and it gets very clumpy, even when using the blender bottle whisk ball. Would recommend using a blender to mix with dairy.As far as how effective the product is, I can tell a noticeable difference from where I started 3 months ago. I've been taking at least one serving a day with water and working out about 4 times a week and I have seen significant results in weight gain. I was pretty wary about using whey while training because I wanted to do it all natural, but at a certain point, eating that much just wasn't feasible with a busy lifestyle and a full time job. Whey helped me fill in the gaps and get the protein I needed to start putting on muscle mass. Definitely recommend this product.

I'm finally getting serious into shaping up and realized that I wasn't getting enough protein in my diet.  I did some research and finally chose this one.  So far I really like it and it mixes very well.  The taste isn't bad,  I went with the ""extreme chocolate milk""  flavor.  My only problem that I've found is for a few hours after I drink it, my stomach starts bubbling.  I set up a routine of 6 days cardio  ( I purchased a bow flex max trainer and it works very well)  and  one rest and a shake afterwards and it seems to be working well for me.  I keep a check on my calories and set a deficit.  One particular shake I have found to be good was 8 ounces of skim milk,  one scoop of Whey powder, one banana, one spoon of peanut butter, one cup of chopped ice and one habanero pepper  ( I know it sounds crazy but if you like the heat, its amazing )  I'll definitely order this again but maybe try a mix it up with a different flavor

Um.. this is so good. Idk what others are saying about the artificial sweetener being too strong. I personally think it’s great and quite the opposite, it’s actually not overbearing like other powders. Maybe they changed the formula back to the original, who knows. But this powder is EVERYTHING! I use this to make a classic peanut butter banana chocolate shake and it’s come out perfect every time. With other protein powders, I’d usually limit my intake to about one scoop per shake just because of how intense the flavor was. But with this one, I can do two (just tested it out) scoops and it’s still delicious, not too sweet. I can probably get away with doing three. This just changed the game for me! Love it

This stuff has been awesome. We have used this whey product for about 3 to 4 years now. It is really great when you're trying to just have some protein when you're watching your weight, or if you're trying to get a bit extra for building some muscle. We tried this new flavor a couple months ago, and even though we loved the stuff before, this stuff even surpasses that in deliciousness. I had trouble drinking protein shakes until we found this brand. This brand is tasty and does not clump up like others. We drink it with water and never have any clumping issues. Even in milk, it is still much better than many other brands we've tried.The flavor we've most recently tried and loved has been the Extreme Milk Chocolate. It is better than the Double chocolate we were using before. This has the following specs per scoop:  24 g protein  120 calories  1 g fat  3 g carbsAll in all, this is a great product and has done well for us. And, like I said, the taste and texture of this far surpasses other brands we've tried over the years!!

I originally ordered strawberry banana, but I received extreme milk chocolate instead. The chocolate flavor was pretty good, but the vanilla ice cream flavor is delicious. I like to make a little smoothie with 1 cup of almond milk, ice cubes, half a cup of blueberries, and 1 scoop of protein powder. The berries can be replaced with other berries or a mixture of berries. Sometimes I also toss in half a banana. The smoothie tastes like heaven.

This whey powder has a lot of proteins and will help you develop your muscles if you have a regular training routine.  I personally think it's the best brand out there in terms of taste and price.  Excellent stuff. I am using On's 100% whey since about a year now and I highly recommend this product.  I want to add to all the good reviews above, it not only gives you quality protein, but is also very easy on the stomach.  The low sodium content is a huge plus even though I don't currently have high blood pressure. Low on carbs so add a banana after you work out but great if you just want to have straight up protein.Extreme Milk Chocolate: 5/5 starsMinimal calories(120 calories per scoop)-Very low carbs and sugars-High quality protein.-High amount of protein person serving(24 grams) Compare to others that only give you 20-22 grams per serving.-Best tasting protein powder i've used.

I wanted to love this because I needed a protein that didn’t make me hate protein, and I needed it to put in my smoothies. This one was not it. I got the order and the outside plastic seal was intact, however there was no air tight seal(I have no idea what to call it). I’m not sure if that’s what effected the taste, however the initial taste is tolerable, but the after taste is not. It tastes like I’m drinking chocolate flavored chemicals. I ignored the reviews saying this and just chalked it up as a bad batch but I’m thinking I got the same bad batch or all of them taste like this. I’m not sure I’ll finish the whole tub. In conclusion GET THE SMALL TUB BEFORE THE BIG ONE. I’m so glad I tried it before fully committing, because this is not the protein for me.

I have purchased about 6 of these over the years and do not use any other brand. They are the best when it comes to whey protein. I have only purchased the milk chocolate and the double rich chocolate. I prefer the double rich chocolate to this one but that is because of my personal shake recipe.The good:-Easy mix ability. (I use a blender with ice but I have used a shaker and it mixes easily)-Low Calories and fat when compared to other powders-Tastes great!!!! ( I mix a small amount of water, a banana, couple of ice cubes, 1 to 1 &1/2 scoops of powder, and a scoop of peanut butter and blend in a blender. It tastes like a dessert and I look forward to it after workouts)The bad:-Nothing other than a slightly higher cost than some other powders but it is worth it.Conclusion:Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. I would try the double rich chocolate too if you do not like this one. I think that one is a little better for the recipe I use but this one tastes great too.

I really love ON Gold standard protein. It's become my ""go to"" brand for supplements for a few reason. First, it's not loaded with extra sugars on carbohydrates. I know that for some, the carbohydrates are actually helpful. For my purposes, I like using my carbs up in other meals, and it's nice having a protein shake that isn't a carb overload. It's also really nice having a large amount of nutritional information on the label.The taste is unlike any other protein I've had. So far I've tried chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla ice cream flavor, all of which have been fantastic. My personal favorite so far has to be the vanilla ice cream. All of them taste better than any other brand I've tried. The powder mixes really well, much better than most other protein powders. After maybe 10 seconds of shaking in a blender bottle, there's no clumps left, just a smooth shake.If you want an awesome tasting protein that is low on carbs but gets the job done with proteins, look no further!

I got the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor, so that is what I am basing my review off of for anyone wondering.I was skeptical to buy after reading some of the reviews about Stevia and lack of quality, but I found that this was a great tasting powder. Not only does it mix and taste well with water (which is something that’s hard to find in a protein powder) but it doesn’t leave me bloated.I think it’s worth the money if you’re not looking for a super expensive protein supplement.

I've tried this brand's French Vanilla Creme flavor of the whey protein. I wasn't a fan of it. It was way too sweet for my taste.I've only tried this one once, but it's the best-tasting whey protein I've tried thus far. I mixed it with maybe a little more than 8 fl oz of just water. It had a very mild but tasty chocolate flavor. It reminded me of Swiss Miss hot chocolate (I think that's been said by others, too).If you like your protein shakes with just water and don't like overly sweet drinks, I highly recommend this one.

Really like this.  I set a goal to run a certain distance in a month.  Toward the end, I had 7 days left, and was about 65% done with my goal.  I was sore, and decided that I was going to meet my goal, but I would never run again in my life!  Some work associates suggested I try a protein shake, and after a couple of days, drinking a shake right after running, I was no longer sore, and was doubling my distance each day.  I love running again.  This brand, and this flavor, hits the mark for me.If you are on the fence about protein shakes, try one.  Buy a small container, in case you don't like it.  Then, once you decide you want to use protein, and you find a flavor you like, buy the larger container.  I started with this 2 lb, and love this flavor (extreme milk chocolate), so I bought the 5 lb tub.  Lots cheaper by-the-pound that way.

Not only does this product taste GREAT, like 5 out of 5, but it is also the best mixing powder I have ever found. It's so light and thin, it is not gritty at ALL and it doesn't get chunky and gross. Doesn't get stuck in the shaker, doesn't make shaker smell or stain it.I really like the way it doesn't make me bloat, unlike some other brands do.Lastly, the 5g of BCAAS are a giant plus. That is something my trainer told me to look for because most people don't get their BCAAS in, since they think the protein alone is good enough. It really is a plus to have them mixed into one shake!It mixes really well with food also, and it's honestly great for recipes since its such a fine, well-mixing powder.*I would definitely recommend this product to everyone out there, especially if you are someone looking for their first protein powder!*

Picked this up in the extreme milk chocolate flavor. I use this as a recovery drink after weight training, and it works great. Really helps me recover and keep my energy up between my workout and my next meal.I use 1 scoop of powder with about 10oz of unsweetened chocolate almond milk and it tastes just like a really good cup of hot cocoa or chocolate frozen yogurt. Not only is it really tasty compared to other flavors of powder I've used, but it's really tasty period. It's the first protein shake I've actually looked forward to having, and it helps satisfy my chocolate cravings for a while. Blends in smoothly and easily with my blender bottle, with no grit like I've had with some other brands.I haven't had any stomach issues or gas issues using this powder, and I have a pretty weak stomach, but I think this seems to be a pretty individual thing, some people will react to whey protein more than others.

I will preface this review by saying it was only recently that I began to take weight lifting seriously and actually taking things like protein powder on a regular basis, so I'm at best a novice on the subject. That said, I think I must have picked very wisely on the first try, thanks mostly to ON having a solid reputation and Amazon reviewers.This stuff is pretty fantastic. It mixes well, great protein from what I can tell, and seems to have helped me make pretty significant gains compared to not using protein powders. The Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor tastes great as well. I will say though, for the first week or so, it did give me a surprising amount of gas. I've been told this is less of a problem with 100% whey isolates, which is in the ON Platinum wheys, but I found it went away after about a week regardless, I assume because my body just got used to it.

Finding protein powders is never easy especially with a semi sensitive stomach. I’ve tried at least 5 brands before being completely happy with this one. I initially bought a smaller container from my local grocery store and once I knew it was fine with my stomach and taste buds I ended up buying this huge container here and just refilling my smaller container. The price on Amazon is a huge value for this size too!It mixes easily into liquid (I use almond milk) and I also use a high speed blender with ice and a frozen banana. The (gourmet) vanilla flavor is the only flavor I’ve bought because I can use it to make EITHER a fruity shake or chocolatey shake just by adding cocoa powder. If I don’t have time to blend a shake or I want something to actually “eat” vs drink. I’ll add 1/2-3/4 scoop right into my instant oatmeal.Getting more protein daily into my diet has been much easier with the help of this powder. I’d highly recommend trying if you haven’tfound one you like yet.Also- there is stevia along with other “natural” artificial flavors. But their whey protein isolate has been working for me so far with no tummy troubles!

I recently tried the Dymatize Elite 100% Whey Protein Powder and overall, I was pretty satisfied with it. The one downside I found was that it can be a bit expensive. However, the taste of the Gourmet Vanilla flavor was very delicious and enjoyable, which made it easy for me to incorporate it into my daily routine. Another positive aspect is that it is a fast-digesting formula which helps my muscles to recover quickly after workout. Overall, I would recommend the Dymatize Elite 100% Whey Protein Powder to anyone looking for a high-quality protein supplement with a great taste, despite the slightly higher cost.

I am very picky with my protein. This has whey protein isolate, leucine, and low carb which are the most important things when looking for a protein powder. Also, I need something that mixes well with water. I’m a vet and there were many times when deployed I would just add protein to a bottled water and I played around with many different proteins to see what could mix well with water without a shaker cup and still taste good. This protein is one of the top 3. It’s recently since moved from my #1 slot because of the price increase. Especially the better flavors👎🏼. Vanilla is my favorite besides chocolate peanut butter. The vanilla mixed with milk tastes just like a thin vanilla milkshake.

This has been my absolute favorite chocolate protein powder - until now. It’s okay and drinkable, but my expectations for it were definitely higher. The chocolate flavor isn’t bad, it’s just bland. Not the rich, wonderful flavor it had before. It’s also 20 more calories than the prior product, not that it makes much of a difference but enough to add to the disappointment. I would buy this again if I had to, but I will be shopping other protein powders first to see if I can find one that packs a better flavor punch.

I have been into fitness my entire life. I always begin each day with a whey protein drink. This in my opinion is the BEST on the market and what a fantastic price.  Try it once and you will become addicted to it.  I add a banana to the chocolate mix in the blender and it is like a milkshake. No fake chocolate tastes like many others have.I also use the Vanilla. Vanilla I can add ANY fruit I like. This has BCAA. VERY healthy. If you need to lose weight, maintain or just for a healthy start in the mornings ..................... this is the way to go! 😁😊

I've tried 6 or 7 different low and no carb protein powders in the last 2 years. This stuff is the best if the bunch. In taste, mix ability, muscle care, etc. Sometimes I'll eat nothing but protein pancakes for 3 days straight and be fine with it. Feels like I'm cheating. Tastes like vanilla birthday cake. Mix 3 eggs, 3 scoops of this, and a few splashes of almond milk (check the label, almond milk can be 17g of carbs, or 1g. I buy the cheapest stuff from Walmart or Aldi's that has 1g or even <1g carb). Mix it all up, if it's too runny, add some more powder. Put the batter on a griddle after rubbing it down with butter. Flip after 3 mins. And in about 5 mins you'll have the best tasting pancakes. I like lots of butter and that's my diet - high fat, zero sugar which some day increases testosterone. Out of all the proteins on Amazon, all in the $35-$55 range for 4 or 5 pounds, nothing works as well as this stuff. Adding baking soda only makes it bloated and brings out the egg taste way too much so I skip it. If you want to lose a few inches in 3 weeks, each these for 2 meals a day. Or, do yourself a favor and get a good shaker cup. You can make a 75g protein milkshake in one cup and you're good. Bottom line is, I've bought them all, tried them all, and Dymatize Elite is by far the best in all categories. Tastes great, truly. I feel like I should be getting fat eating this and drinking this because it's so tasty. It's worth the extra few dimes a day! Save yourself the trial and error and several hundred bucks - I did that for you. One caveat- I can only vouch for vanilla. It's my favorite but I can't imagine it's much different in other flavors. I like syntha-6 cookies and cream too, but it didn't cook as well. Sandy pancakes. Enjoy! Grab a tub.

Really like this stuff. I take it with milk and like the vanilla and rich chocolate the best. The rich chocolate seems to blend better than the vanilla. I use a handshaker and the vanilla chunks up more but I don't care. If you can't handle chunks then just use a blender. Has the branch chain amino acids in it as well so that's convenient. Saw this powder verified on another site that its ingredients and protein content are pretty accurate to what's on the label. I do about 3 protein shakes and day with 1 scoop and 8 ounces of milk. Been using for 6 months now and have it on subscription.

After buying protein powder for almost 20 years, it's come down to two things that drive value for me: ease of mixing with a spoon and flavor. Flavor is fine and the first container mixed pretty well, right up there with the better ones I've tried, but the second container is firmly in the middle of the pack. I've seen this result time and again with other brands - they just can't seem to ensure every batch mixes easily.

* I've replaced this for milk in cereal, oatmeal, coffee, etc. It's a great milk replacement* Of all the protein mixes, this one dissolves the best; it's not sandy, it's nice and smooth and a great mouth feel* it's low in sugar so maybe it's not best for a pre-workout if you need an energy boost, but that's gives you more control over what your protein intake is.* Supposedly the protein quality is good which I take with a grain of salt, but I'm glad to take a high quality protein along side of a versatile macro substitute.

Some proteins drinks and powders I have tried have an after taste or they are too sweet.  The Dymatize Elite 100% Whey Protein Powder has 25g Protein, 5.5g BCAAs & 2.7g L-Leucine and is quick absorbing.  The cost per serving is great!  I would highly recommend the vanilla protein power with almond milk, fresh fruit or use some french vanilla cold press coffee,  mix in a blender with ice....SO GOOD...Better than Smoothie King!!!

I have been lifting weights and training for long distance races for years now, so I've tried many different whey protein powders to complement my diet. After reading the reviews, I decided to give this a shot. I can only have hydrolyzed whey because I am lactose intolerant, and of all options, this has been my favorite. I've tried the fruit pebble (yep), cookies and cream, and vanilla. Vanilla has been my favorite because I can mix it with coffee and any flavored smoothie. Fruit pebble is way too sweet for me, but it was worth trying. Cookies and cream is very similar to vanilla for some reason, but maybe sweeter. I recommend this to literally all my friends to whom I give fitness advice. Ah, the only downside (besides the price) of this protein is that it doesn't mix well with hot foods (e.g. oatmeal), but that is expected for hydrolyzed whey. You have to mix with water separately and then pour wherever you want. I recommend and am buying it again!

The cholesterol is just insane to me.1 use for the day and you have used 25% of your daily cholesterol intake.That's why I have rated this 3 stars and not 5.The taste is very good I mean really good.And it's a huge barrel of protein powder so that's great. I'm on month 3 and still have half of the container left.It's a okay protein powder. And just okay.Not good or great.

This was my go to brand for my whey protein then suddenly they stopped making there isolate and replace it with this ""Elite"" version for the same price, I will admit my fault for not reading the ingredients but why would you cheap out on the product and keep the price like it was still high value bad business, this is just whey concentrate and if your lactose intolerant beware this will bloat you and make you gassy I should of known they went cheap when a scoop of this is 34 grams to get the 25 grams of protein versus the Isolate which was 30 gram scoop for 25 grams of protein company got greedy especially since if you want actual high quality you need to buy the next grade up which is an extra 30 dollars per tub.

I've used a now discontinued version of Dymatize for a year and have been very satisfied with it.  This one has apparently 3 different types/versions of whey -- why? -- and it went from 106 calories per scoop to 140, and the price increased quite a lot.  They've also added carrageenan, which is highly inflammatory.  Why or why would you mess up a good product?

I like the Dymatize whey protein line because it has a good taste and has fewer calories for the amount of protein then most other brands. That doesn't mean that the taste of the product suffers. In fact, I like the Dymatize flavors more then most of the other brands I have tried. After having tried the Chocolate fudge and the Peanut Butter flavors from Bymatize, I bought the 5lb package of the Rich Chocolate flavor.The price was less for the Rich Chocolate flavor then the two flavors I had tried, but the value was definitely there, so I decided to take a risk and give Rich Chocolate a try. My verdict is that Rich Chocolate tastes good. I have no complaints. That being said, I do prefer the Chocolate fudge and even the peanut butter flavors over the rich chocolate. At 1/3 the cost of the chocolate fudge flavor, I am happy with my purchase of rich chocolate and don't regret buying the 5lb size.If you are value conscious and you see a deal on the Rich Chocolate flavor, go ahead and order it. If you see Chocolate Fudge for the same cost, I would recommend ordering the Chocolate Fudge.

I've been using Dymatize Elite 100% Whey Protein Powder (vanilla flavor) for over a decade and have never had any issues until recently. I opened a new container a few weeks ago and immediately smelled a disgustedly strange odor and thought maybe it went bad but went ahead and tried it anyway since the expiration date was 12/23. Well it tasted just as bad as it smelled so I immediately returned it and ordered another one. Opened the replacement and it had the same exact nasty smell and taste. The expiration date and lot number was the same as the first one I purchased so all I can recommend is beware of Lot Number M101126C. Makes me wonder if corn starch was used as a filler because that's exactly what it smelled like - yuck.

I actually consume anywhere from 2 to 3 scoops per day. Honestly, I started purchasing Optimum Nutrition because my brother (a fitness buff) highly recommends it and a YouTube influencer that I respect also highly recommends it. There's nothing fancy about it, but it does the job and blends well.I add a scoop to my oatmeal, a scoop to my smoothie, and may consumer another scoop in just juice or almond milk (without a blender).When using a blender, I find it best to blend all other ingredients first (blueberries, spinach, ginger, strawberries) and then add the protein power and only blend for a few seconds. Otherwise, it gets too ""fluffy"" and airy.My favorite flavor is vanilla because it blends well with my oatmeal and smoothies.

I just got this today. I have a small pouch of this flavor and love it! This huge jug was a lot cheaper per oz and won’t go to waste. Optimum Nutrition is the only whey protein I use. Vanilla ice cream is rich and tastes like a dessert!

I've Used Whey protein for years. I love that it's doctor recommended. It's especially great to have after a workout because it has nutrients that are designed for muscle growth and muscle repair. Despite the price still worth it because the container lasts a long time so the cost balances out. Additionally, since I started making protein shakes I have lost over 35 pounds and look and feel much better.

I like this brand because you don't need multiple scoops for a 24-30g serving of protein, but the prices on this have gone just absolutely off the rails. I don't like supporting companies that price gouge so bad but they are better than the competition. This stuff is nearly $20 more expensive than it was a year ago. Totally nuts.

I've tried many different types of proteins, but I've always been a huge fan of the good old fashioned Gold Standard.Price: (4.5/5)5-Pounds for ~$55 is a great deal.  You can probably find it a bit cheaper other places, but nobody else delivers in 2 days or for free.  If you go into GNC or any other large supplement store, they are going to charge you around $70 for the same product. Also, if you are someone who buys pre-made protein shakes at $2-$3 a pop, STOP RIGHT NOW!  One scoop of Gold Standard has 24g and at the current going rate of $58, that’s about $0.75 a shake.  Plus, the 5-pound bucket should last you at least 1-2 months, as long as you aren’t taking 3 scoops a day.Flavor: (4.5/5)This is category that will trip up most people when buying protein.  I don’t care what anybody says, taste matters.  If you are going to be drinking a shake every day, or nearly so, you don’t want a nasty, chalky, chunky drink.  This is something that Gold Standard does really well.  I like the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor a lot, but their Delicious Strawberry, Banana Cream, Strawberry Banana, and Double Rich Chocolate Flavors are all awesome as well.  The recommended 8 oz. of water per scoop is a little high for me, as I like a creamier shake, so I usually put 6 oz. in and it’s perfect.  I’ve also had a lot of success putting scoops of protein in various smoothies, on PB and J sandwiches, in my yogurt etc.  The only better tasting brand of protein I’ve ever had is Syntha-6, but for the extremely low fat and carbohydrate ratio in ON-Gold Standard, this one tastes amazing.Mixibility: (5/5)This is one of the easiest mixing proteins I’ve ever had.  My shaker bottle makes short work of any powder, but even if I forget that, a spoon in a cup or even just shaking up a scoop in a bottle (sans blender ball) does the trick.  As I said earlier, I put protein in my yogurt some days (by the way, Vanilla protein in plain yogurt = vanilla yogurt… mind blown) and even that takes minimal mixing with a spoon to get it completely mixed in.Ingredients: (5/5) I touched on it earlier, but Gold Standard does it right with their ratio.  24g of protein in only one scoop, with less than 1 gram of fat, 1 gram of sugar, and 2 grams of carbs.  Also, it has been a long standing tradition with ON to only use high-quality protein isolates, which, if you care about your body at all, is a very good quality for a company to display.

I've tried a lot of protein drink mixes over the years and the ON Gold is by far the best tasting and the one I've had the best result with. I'm not a big guy, I'm a guy with a small frame that was just shy of 180 lbs when I started using this product and after 5 months I'm now under 150 lbs and I'm now far more muscular and quite lean. while that weight is below what I'd like the mirror tells me that it suits me pretty well and in the end it's what i look like that's more important than what I 'think"" I should weigh.Now I'm not going to sit here and tell you that all this was done by drinking this magic Whey protein as that wouldn't be true. I also cut my daily carbs way down and increased protein intake. I don't eat bread anymore, i cut way down on deserts except on special occasions and just plain eat healthier. I drink this stuff twice a day one before my workouts and one right after. I lift heavy weights for about 40 minutes each work day and then do HIT on a rower for about 20 minutes making my workouts around an hour each day before work (getting up at 3:40AM is rough, but it's paying off). I have to eat like a horse now just to keep from losing more weight because the muscle I've built up is burning calories all day long!I snack on other protein sources throughout the day which include peanuts, natural peanut butter (right out of the jar), high protein Greek yogurt, a hard boiled egg and sometimes a protein bar. I also drink about 10 80z cups of water through the day. And by the way I'm just on the cusp of turning 50 and my build is better now then when i was lifting in my early 20's! I credit that in part to ON Gold as I'm sure the ingredients are far superior to what i took those many years ago. I'm also lifting weights that are a little bit heavier than when I was in my prime as well. i don't have the endurance i had back then, but my strength is actually slightly better now then it's ever been.I've tried Vanilla Ice Cream, Double Rich Chocolate, Rocky Road and a mint one (forget the name). My favorite is the Rocky road, but I usually buy the Vanilla Ice Cream because I get more for my money and I blend it with just a a couple strawberries and a few blueberries to give it some extra flavor and it's very good.

Meant to order Double Chocolate, but fat fingered this flavor and have to say I'm happy with that ""mistake.""  Years since I used a protein supplement and there are obvious improvements.  Ordered not because of how hard I work out, but because I dont eat the amount of protein I used to, dont have the same appetite, and thought a serving or two a day would be good a good idea.  It does fill you up making it easier to resist grabbing some pretzels or chips.Amazing how much easier it blends in just cold water.  From my recollection there would always be chunks, some stuck to the bottom or sides of the glass, but with this drop a scope in, stir for 10-15 seconds and it's good to go.  The taste is also vastly improved.  I distinctly remember chugging each serving to minimize the time I had to taste it.  Not that I would sip this, but it's got a decent flavor and what do you expect from something that is over 80% protein by calorie?  With low cholesterol per serving and highly concentrated protein source by calories it's perfect for multiple things.Can't really say if it helps with muscle gain or recovery since my days of working out frequently and intensely are over, but it does keep an aging for former gym rat from reaching for an empty calorie snack.  If somehow it turns back the clock and my workouts start improving I will be sure to update it, but right now couldnt be happier with the product.

The vanilla ice cream flavor is much, much better than I expected.  It may even be my overall favorite.  Glad I ordered a whole 5-pound drum of it.It tastes almost exactly like vanilla ice cream, minus the calories and without the chokingly rich milk-sugar throat feel.Literally I like it better than actual ice cream.It is difficult to resist drinking 2-4 of these per day.What's more: it blends better than any of the other flavors I have tried to date, and I have tried a lot of them.  Malted milk probably blends worst, while vanilla ice cream and coffee blend best.Coffee is also incredibly good, but seems to have actual caffeine or related compounds left over in it; I am sensitive to it, to the point that even decaf gives me skin problems, but small amounts are ok.Anyway, I like to mix this with creatinine, d-ribose, tyrosine, beta-alanine, taurine, and a few more uncommon personal favorite ingredients for the perfect early afternoon boost.  Everything blends in perfectly, no chunks to break up with a butter knife, so whatever additives make it blend seem to help dissolve any other custom items I like to add as well.  In other words, it is very compatible with extra supplements.I like this one better than french vanilla, too.  Overall just very impressive work by the R&D team at this company, will keep buying as long as it exists.

Just bought this and I had to stick my hand and forearm into the jug to find the scooper. A good amount of the powder spilled into the kitchen sink just trying to find the stupid scooper buried at the very bottom. Are we NOT supposed to find it until we're done with the jug?  I also spent an hour trying to research how much I'm supposed to take (that is, I researched what their scoop is equivalent to... a teaspoon, tablespoon, etc.. with no luck). I read other reviews here that said to use a spoon or kitchen tongs to look for the scooper, and I had given up. Then I wanted to contact Amazon's customer service, but first I'm supposed to contact the manufacturer who will not even reply to me unless I bought it straight from them --- so I gave it one last chance, and stuck my arm (forearm deep) into the bucket and swirled around until I felt something when I was literally scraping the bottom of the barrel with my fingernails. I pulled out a gold colored scooper. There it was. And there also was a mess in my kitchen sink of powder wasted. At least tell the customer how much the scooper is equivalent to, so no one has to go through this. . . .  I will update this review in the future as far as the whey protein and its effects. -- For now, only 1 star for making me waste what I purchased.---UPDATE JUNE 15, 2013--------So after using the Whey Protein, I'll raise the stars from 1 to 4.  (I'm still pissed about the scooper, so no 5 stars.)  As for the product, I'm not using to grow muscle at this point, so I can't comment on that. I've been using the Whey Protein to preserve the muscles I already have as I lose weight (burn fat) by taking in enough protein while dieting. I guess my muscles are being preserved, so good product I'd say. The taste at first was not the Vanilla Ice Cream as expected. It tasted more like Vanilla Ice Cream with metal and pennies in it. If you go into this expecting the actual taste, you'll be disappointed. But if you go in expecting a metallic taste, then you'll be surprised that there's some vanilla flavor in there too. I got used to the taste after a few months of use.

In summary: High protein per serving, a lot of added aminos (no need to add extra glutamine), about $8 cheaper here than at supplement stores that rhyme with PNC, mixes well, tastes good, and does not spoil quickly.I am a casual lifter and a fan of optimum nutrition (""ON"").  Between that and muscle milk, I have been using these products for approximately 10 years.  Last year I decided to branch out and try another whey supplements given that I have never really tried others; I just went right to ON.  So I tried 3-4 types.Aaaaaand now I am back with ON.  I had marked less gains and recovered noticeably slower with other protein wheys than I did with ON.  I imagine part of that is all the amino acids and other things in ON, whereas many other wheys are just the whey or minimum amounts of the extras.By no means am I a fitness junkie like I was in high school or college, and certainly just a causal lifter now, but I still do full-body workouts and I find my body needing more then just whey.  ON has just become my staple and it mixes well while taking good.  I frequently mix it with oatmeal in the morning for breakfast, or on the weekend with ice cream.  I like the plain vanilla flavor just by itself, but it mixes well with pretty much everything (fruit or peanut butter).The amount of protein per serving is fairly high and there are a lot of amino acids added which make buying extra aminos or glutamine a thing of the past for me.  I rather just have to mix on thing than create a concoction of everything--especially when running late in the morning.I recommend this to causal lifters or high school/college athletes, which is what I had used it for.  I can't say I would recommend it for body builders, merely because--well--I am not a body builder.  But I imagine they may be satisfied too.

Optimum Nutrition makes a good quality whey protein that tastes pretty good and has some of the better ingredients (provided you stick with basic flavors like Vanilla Ice Cream, Double Rich Chocolate, and Strawberry) than many other whey protein supplements. It also mixes quickly and easily with a simple shaker cup in 4-8 ounces of water. Yes, it will taste better with milk, almond milk, oat milk, or cashew milk (and be a little thicker).

I've ordered 5lb vanilla twice recently. Amazon shipped a product manufactured almost a year ago (manufactured 12/20 ordered on 10/21). ON shipped a product from a newer batch (manufactured 5/21 ordered on 6/21). There is a difference in after taste and consistency, but it is still the same powder. Just not as good as the fresher, more recently manufactured product.Despite this, the flavor and consistency are much better than any other powder I've tried. ON is a great brand. I've never experienced any negative side effects from this powder and I drink 2 scoops a day mixed with milk & fruit, sometimes an extra scoop with cereal or oatmeal at breakfast or yogurt at dinner.It is usually cheaper to order on Amazon, my take is just order from wherever suits your needs better.

Notice increased rate of recovery and increase in gains within the first few weeks of using it.Been taking it 3 times a day. (One in the morning w/ breakfast & before workout, one after my workout, and one before I go to bed.)My biggest gripe is that I got the Rocky Road flavor, while good tasting, it contains sucralose (splenda) in it.While I'm not terribly concerned because the amount of the sweeter is very low in the powder. (i.e. You would need several large scoops (1/4-1/6 of the container) before you even came close to the amount that is in one can of soda)Next time I purchase I will be buying the vanilla flavor as it does not contain sucralose in it.I cannot say whether sucralose has any long term health effects, but if it does, I would prefer not to find out on myself.Happy with the results, not very happy to discover sucralose in it. Since it's my own fault for not researching properly, I see no reason not to give this product five stars because it works beautifully.ON is one of the only companies that has been found not to lie or alter the truth on their labels. Other companies that offer protein powders can differ by up to 20% on their labels, so do your research!I used to buy BCAA's and Glutameine seperately, but since this is a blend, it fulfills my daily intake of what I usually would take, saves me money.I also take ON's creatine powder w/ the protein powder three times daily. I found using the creatine w/ the protein powder helps it mix with the water better so I don't have powder at the bottom.

I wanted to write a review about this since I realized I’ve been using it for years. I checked my order history and the first time I ordered it was 2011 and it’s now 2020 so it’s been quite awhile. My favorite flavor is vanilla ice cream and I can use it with vanilla flavored things and also chocolate flavored things and it’s not a distinct vanilla flavor which is really nice. I like the chocolate flavor as well and I’ve tried a few of the other flavors but I’ve found they have some odd after tastes so I don’t use those anymore. My husband likes this protein for his shakes and I just had a baby so I’m using it to make protein oatmeal to keep my milk supply up. I mix it with chocolate pb2 and a spoonful of pb and it’s great. I’m not working out yet but I’ll have it in a shake once I get there. It’s easy, the ingredients aren’t terrible and the taste is great. Plus the price is on point.

Definitely glad I got this protein. Optimum Nutrition is always the best way to go when it comes to supplements, as they always deliver on quality, and effectiveness. I love how smoothly this stuff mixes in just about ANYTHING, seriously. And it tastes amazing, I don't feel like I've gotta just slap it down. Tastes good mixed with your favorite drink, or with just plain water. I use this to lose weight, so most of the time I mix it with just water. But sometimes I like to mix it with milk or orange juice or even into my oatmeal or yogurt. I also love that it only has 1g of sugar in it, and it is very low on calories. It is easy on my stomach, I am lactose intolerant and this protein is lactose-free which is perfect. No gassy feeling after drinking it. I would suggest getting the 5lb tub or even the 10lb. It lasts you a lot longer, and the price on here is the best, considering you also don't need to worry about shipping, not only that, in stores, 5lbs of this stuff will easily run you at twice as much as here.. You WILL be spoiled after using this stuff, you won't want to use anything else, certainly nothing below standard. Only protein even better than this stuff is the Platinum Standard Hydro Whey, also by Optimum Nutrition. The only reason I don't use that is because it is not lactose-free and I did experience a bit of gas for a while. But you can't go wrong with anything by ON.Update February 2021: this stuff is still the best and a go-to. Recently purchased the Banana Cream flavor and it is DELICIOUS. Still swear by and highly recommend Optimum Nutrition's products.

I've been using this for years now.The research suggests that about .8 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day is optimal for maximizing muscle protein synthesis (in combination with resistance training of course). That's a lot of protein, and it can be hard to eat that much without also going overboard on the fat and carbs. This is an easy and delicious way to get extra protein in your diet. It dissolves easily and tastes great. I mix it with water or milk depending on how many carbs I want at the moment. I also mix it with oatmeal in the mornings. Pro tip: mix the whey powder thoroughly with 1/4 or 1/2 cup of *cold* water before you mix it in with the hot oatmal to avoid lumps.

Tried the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor - it was better than expected. Really easy to blend into smoothies or my morning yogurt. The tub I got was pretty full - definitely seemed like 5lbs worth of protein.I also like the protein per calorie level of this brand. It is expensive, but not unreasonable. As someone that has tried a LOT of brands of protein, I'd generally recommend a normal vanilla flavor as they tend to be more versatile and easy to gulp down.

I writing this review on 5lb - french vanilla.Pro1) It tastes so smooth and nice. I couldn't taste any chemical taste to it as I did with my previous whey. Sometimes, I work out so that I can justify myself to drink this (not even joking)2) It mixes real well with water and 2% low fat milk. I haven't t tried other drink but I had no problem with water and milk.3) It works. After heavy weight lifting, my sore muscles used to take 3~4 days to completely recover and ready for the next round. With this whey it takes me about 2~3 days and I can feel my muscles growing faster than before. I actually started to gain weight a little faster.4) Reliability. This product has been out in the market and used by many customer for years. You can rely on this whey and not worry about banned chemicals, etc.5) Fair price. I won't say this is the cheapest one out there. But it is definitely  a good price for its performance and safety.ConI couldn't find it yet. I will update it if I see one.Overall, I definitely recommend this product. I did find some cheaper products on Amazon but I did not risk my health over like 5~10 bucks. For the quality of the product, the price is definitely fair and I will buy it again when it runs out.

I've never used whey protein powder in my life, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I imagined a strong, sweet, artificial flavor and maybe some clumps. Wrong on both counts. I bought the vanilla ice cream flavor, planning to mix it into some almond milk. Before adding extra calories, I figured I would at least TRY it with water first. So glad I did! The flavor is NOT strong or super sweet AT ALL. It's super, super subtle. Clumps? None. It's perfect. This stuff is perfect. Highly recommended.

This was recommended to my Husband by a professional. So when I came across it, I thought okay cool I'll surprise him with it! He loves everything Vanilla, go figure the taste is his favorite thing about it. I do mix it with ice and put in blender. Sometimes he'll go behind me and add a little more powder. I wouldn't suggest it but he has been fine doing so. He started this for about 2 weeks before he started a regular exercise routine. Let me tell you this dude has begun to fill out in places I thought he would always be scrawny in. He also has hyperthyroidism and has quit being a baby about it once he began drinking this regularly. Would absolutely recommend and repurchase. Also, it is HUGE!

I have used this product for several years and it has remained outstanding in taste, while blending with fruit, yogurt and lo-fat milk. I blend all those ingredients together and make a shake about 16 oz. for a mid day meal. It is a little heavy to pick up when full, as I keep it out of sight.I remind anyone that the scoop will be near the bottom of the powder, when opening the first time, and a long knife or utensil will be needed to find it. Once you know that, then it is easy to find it. I keep a scoop in a drawer so I can use it with the next order and not have to dig for the new one. EEZY PEEZY. I have found no other product with these ingredients for this great price. Enjoy.

I have been using Optimum's 100% Whey Vanilla Ice Cream powder for several years. It is great-tasting, easy to mix up, and easy to digest. It is super convenient to add protein any time of day or night. My favorite mixing bottle to use is the Blender Bottle. In my opinion this flavor is one of Optimum's best, if not the best one. 5 stars.UPDATE: 2017Something changed in the formulation recently. The protein seems to thicken way up, too much. I like making a couple shakes the night before work so I have them chilled for breakfast and lunch. They used to thicken slightly overnight (I make them with milk). Now, they are VERY thick in the morning, it is almost unappetizing. I am thinking some cellulose or 'gums' were added.It was such a great mix, taste, texture before, why screw it up? When customers find a product they like, don't change it!I have noticed that if I use maybe 1/2 water and 1/2 milk it is less thick, but the thickening agents don't make it better. If you use a blender and ice, it will already get thicker.Note to Optimum: change the formula back to the 2016-ish and before recipe, that was much better. The flavor is still good now, but whatever makes it 'thicker' has made me knock off a star (or maybe 2).Of note, I have been a long-time purchaser of Optimum Nutrition products, starting with Pro Complex protein back in the 1980's.

I've purchased this whey about 5 times...and many other brands over the years.  I am very happy with the solubility of this powder--it does blend in a shaker cup with water or milk.  I like to mix the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor with milk, so one scoop + 8 oz. milk yields about 32 grams of protein.  I have no idea if it's true, but I've read that the body can't absorb more than about 40 grams of protein with any one meal, so I don't bother with more than one scoop at a time.Many of the other brands I've purchased over the years do not taste as good or blend as well, although this is mostly subjective.  A few brands have a metallic taste--not the Gold Standard.  Also, the GS has 30 mg of Cholesterol (10% daily value/2000 calorie diet), which is 10 mg or so lower than other brands (and even other GS flavors, which is why I stick with Vanilla IC).  The 5 lb container includes 77 scoops.If you are wondering, I have tried other flavors, but I keep coming back to the Vanilla Ice Cream.  First of all, you can always add fruit to this flavor, or Hershey's Syrup if you're in the mood.  I like a frozen fruit berry blend from Target with milk and powder in the blender; the frozen fruit gives it a fruit-smoothie texture!

Using my kitchen scale, it takes a scoop and a half, almost 2 full scoops, to get a 31 gram serving. Seems kinda scammy in that aspect. Also, it does not have they nice smooth taste of other protein powders. It does mix well, and considering I have a food scale and can measure portions, it will work, but unless I weigh out the whole bucket I'm not sure it will have as many servings as advertised. I really just wanted to let everyone know that if you are looking to get the nutrition value of ""one serving"" you are going to need about a scoop and a half.

This is a really great whey protein powder. The quality is very good and the ingredients and ratios are great. It even has ""Lactase"" as a final ingredient, which is the enzyme that helps you digest lactose if you are lactose intolerant like me. And, I even didn't have any issues on my first protein shake I made (which was this stuff, blended with almond milk, frozen chopped spinach, and a banana. But, then, I had another shake later in the day that was just the protein and almond milk and that did affect my stomach a little bit and gave me gas. I think that the lastase in this probably isn't enough for my body. And, it doesn't acutally tell you how much GALU is in it (for reference a serving of Lactaid has 9000 GALU which equals three tablets of Lactaid, and I don't think that much is a in a single scoop of whey protein here; so I offset it now by taking a single tablet of Lactaid or an equal off brand and that solves my digestive issues).I recommend this powder for any serious exerciser, whether or not you are doing aerobic or anaerobic. Please vote yes below. Thanks!

The product itself is fine. This review is for the subscription. I signed up to save the extra 5%. I have received two shipments thus far and both  times the inner seal was broken. The cover took no resistance to remove and the powder spilled all-over my counter. Normally with a product like this you peal the inner seal back, this insures freshness and let's you know the product was not tampered with. The seal simply came off inside the cover with no resistance and explosion of powder on my counter.  I have no way of knowing the powder is fresh and untampered. Secondly the 2nd shipment was the wrong flavor. I ordered Vanilla and got double chocolate. I hate chocolate when it's a protein powder, and it wasn't even the milk chocolate, it was double, so double hate it. Not that I'm going drink it anyway.

I have not tried every protein powder available, but compared to the ones I have liked this one the best.  It also isn't loaded up with sugar like many other brands, which is cool.  I actually prefer the vanilla ice cream flavor.It says instantized so that it mixes readily with a spoon, but you need to really whip it to get the chunks out if you're just using a spoon to mix it into water or milk.  But yeah, totally mixable with a spoon, which is also cool.I read the one star reviews, and they're all complaining about the taste.  Again, check the nutritional label:  there's only 1 gram of sugar.  It is not sweet, at all.I didn't like the sugary, more calorie dense ""better tasting"" powders like Body Fortress and stuff.  I'm not using a protein powder for the delicious flavor of whey products, I'm using it to supplement my protein intake, period.I'd really recommend drinking the vanilla mixed into milk.  It's definitely not awesome in water.When mixed with water, I'd add some other vanilla flavoring to pump it up.  If I'm in a hurry for breakfast I'll throw in a no sugar added Carnation Instant Breakfast Vanilla flavor, and the two vanilla powders in water are 100% potable and inoffensive.

ON whey protein powder is usually a pretty solid product and at a relatively decent price.  It also dissolves quite easily in water and depending on what flavor you get, or on your taste buds, it can taste pretty good.  Based on my experience, and if I'm only drinking it with water, I would go with Strawberry and Cream, Double Rich Chocolate and Rocky Road (in that order).  The flavor I recently received was Vanilla Ice Cream and I think it's horrible, so I would stay away from it, but I also realize that taste is subjective.  I've gotten Vanilla Ice Cream in the past and don't remember it tasting this bad, so perhaps they changed the formula, but it's not a flavor I plan on ever getting again -- it tastes extremely artificial with a horrible aftertaste; I will just stick the ones I previously mentioned.

I got the vanilla ice cream flavor.  This isn't quite as tasty as the Isopure creamy vanilla protein powder, but the price is better so I think I'm willing to sacrifice a little flavor.  Isopure is more of just a creamy almost powdered milk-like flavor with a hint of vanilla flavoring whereas this one is heavy on the imitation vanilla/birthday cake-y flavor and I'm not a huge fan of it.  I know some people are really into the synthetic vanilla/fake cookies sort of flavors you often find in protein powders and bars, so you might really like this.  I might repurchase this it's a pretty big tub and I could see myself getting sick of the flavor eventually.  Other than that, though, it performs well as a protein supplement.

ON Gold standard is one of the best there is, of the many I have tried, it is the best. This Vanilla Ice Cream flavor is sweeter and more vanillay than the regular vanilla, which makes it all the more better to drink.  It mixes decently in a shaker cup, granted i always mix with cold milk, but there's always a few lingering chunks.  no problems in a blender or with room temp water. Will continue to buy this brand, thos will experiment more with flavors.

Like most protein shakes, if you just add water it is not going to taste like you went to Dairy Queen. but with a few recipes you can make some excellent tasting drinks.-= Vanilla Shake =-To start, find your round spoon buried inside your container. Its in there, just use a kitchen spoon to dig around and find it.- 1 scoop of protein. (vanilla ice cream flavor)- 1 cup of milk. (add more milk as desired)- 2 ice cubes.- 1 scoop vanilla ice cream. (optional)- Blend 10 seconds.Even without ice cream it taste great.. for me, I don't worry about fat so I enjoy the bonus time to time. Don't have a blender?  no problem, put 2 cubes in ziplock and smash em in a towel lol.I even throw a scoop of protein in my waffle mix on weekends to mix it up.. So don't worry about flavor.. you can put protein in anything..  drink it raw, or give it love, it is up to you..Hope this helps all those who worry about flavor. Just remember, protein doesn't come as a jar of cookies..  you gotta make the cookies.

Satisfied with the flavor, the contents, and the results I’m seeing from using this product. Although there is one minor issue. The specific flavor I bought claimed to not have sucralose, the “vanilla ice cream” flavor. But as the product arrived, I saw the ingredient was actually in the product and I was disappointed to see that. I would rather a product not have an artificial sweetener, but it’s hard to find a good quality protein with glutamine and amino acids at a reasonable price. So this is the best of a bad situation, being completely honest. Would much rather have a product with natural sugar, but I can’t complain too much. I’m seeing results and have had no other problems as far as consumption with this product. It’s easily mixed and tastes phenomenal while giving me results in the weight room I need within a month of using. Would reccomend. 8.5/10 (would be 10/10 without sucralose)

I freeze a banana in little slices and when I mix them with water and the powder, it comes out like the consistency of a milkshake.  It's like going to Dairy Queen after each workout.  This product helps with recovery and lessens the soreness of a workout.  Being over 50 and on a diet, this product has worked very well to help me drop fat and increase muscle, while helping me reduce cholesterol (hard to keep cholesterol down when increasing protein intake).  Even if you are not using this product to work out, I'd suggest it as a way to keep protein intake up while reducing cholesterol and fat intake.

The two major problems I've had with other shakes are 1) They taste terrible and 2) They don't mix well (or when mixed, they foam up so much that you're basically eating instead of drinking them). This shake has neither problem - I totally disagree with other commenters about a foul taste - this is actually delicious. I got the vanilla ice cream flavor and mixed with water it tastes really good. It's not at all too sweet or gross to me, on the contrary it has a pleasant, mild taste.

Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard whey protein powder mixes easily with water or milk.  I like the reputation ON has for purity and quality, and the calorie/protein ratio is excellent (just 120 calories/24 gram protein).  I have tried 4 flavors of this, all very good, but I like the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor the best, and Chocolate Mint second best.  The other two I tried I'd say it was a tie - French Vanilla Crème and Extreme Milk Chocolate, and as I mentioned those are very good too.  I often like to mix this up in a large glass with half skim milk, half water, and add several ice cubes or crushed ice.  Let it chill for a bit from the ice and it's delicious.  I find the 5lb container to be convenient and cost-effective.

I like the versatility of the of the product it goes well with my organic juice cleanse powder. I've been using this product since the spring of 2005. they've actually improved the flavor a few years ago. My only dislike is their scoop, the handle is in the middle causing it to collect powder and the scoop is also opaque so one cannot see if there are any pockets. Fortunately I've saved some of the earlier scoops which are clear enabling one to see any pockets and the handle is at the top preventing any product from collecting on the outside. I have informed them of this several times,but to no avail.

Vanilla ice cream flavor came today and gave it a try with my wife.  We both agreed with one scoop and 8 oz of 2% milk it was very good and no grit.  I was expecting a chemical taste.  Nice vanilla flavor.  Yes, the scoop is there you just have to dig for it when you first open it up.  The instructions say to add 6 to 8 oz of your favorite beverage and blend it.  I could not imagine the vanilla ice cream with anything but milk or a smoothie.  Must be a generic label.  My wife had a good idea to use a refillable water bottle and shake it instead of dragging the blender out.  15 seconds of shaking and done.  Great product!

I had been using cheaper whey powders for so long that I forgot just how good ON is. I generally don't like vanilla powders but this is great. It also dissolves very easy. The old stuff I was using doesn't dissolve well and I was always lets with hundreds of tiny clumps floating on the top. That isn't an issue with this ON.Pros: Taste, dissolvability, ingredients.Cons: It costs a little more but not enough more that it's anything prohibitive.

Let me get this out right up front: If you have been drinking this flavor and liked it, DO NOT BUY THE ""NEW AND IMPROVED"" VERSION. Vanilla Ice Cream used to be my favorite flavor of the ON whey line. Used to be, but not anymore. I just received a new bottle, whipped up a cup as usual, and the first thing I noticed was how syrupy and gloppy it was. And when I tasted it, I almost spit it out. Clearly, something had changed -- for the worse! Let's start with the new consistency. The new label shows a variety of viscosity enhancers, eg, cellulose gum, xanthine gum, lecithin -- compounds which I have no problem with in various products -- which were absent in the previous recipe; but in this new formulation, I can best describe the consistency of the blended beverage as sludge-like, sticking thickly to the blender and cup. It is so viscous, I actually found it a bit difficult to swallow. Well, ok,  how about the taste? It is sickeningly sweeter, and the vanilla flavor seems very different (and not in a good way) from the original recipe. Looking at the labels, I see that ON has added sucralose in addition to the orginal acesulfame. This additional sweetener has the effect of changing both the degree and the quality of the original pleasant (IMHO) modestly-sweet taste to a new overbearing artificially-candied taste.  I frankly can't stand it. I don't understand why ON, which makes 24 different flavors, did not simply make a new flavor for people who might enjoy a syrupy, hyper-sweetened, artificial vanilla-like flavor, and just left the original flavor alone for those of us who had developed a liking for it. Don't buy this product if you are expecting the original flavor; the new version is dramatically different. Furthermore, if you have opened it, used it, and found it too disgusting, by all means return the opened bottle like I did. There was absolutely no indication on the website that the recipe had been changed; hence the product is ""not as described on website."" Maybe enough returns will send a message to ON. Maybe they will even revert to the original recipe.By the way (no pun intended), my one star review applies only to the flavor change, not to the general quality of the ON products

Really great protein powder, truly one of the best I've tried. I will be a repeat buyer on this one.  I always buy vanilla, because it's more versatile for everything I do with it: shakes, protein pancakes, overnight oats, and other recipes.

The protein chocolate flavor is tasty. Some reviews have mentioned that a previous formula was much tastier, but there's nothing wrong with how it is now. Tastes great and mixes well with skim milk, beet powder, creatine powder, tart cherry powder, powdered peanut butter, and any other kind of goodie you want to add to make it super healthy.  You can even toss a couple of eggs in and blend it for even more protein.At its current price of $40.00, it only costs half of what many competitors charge, and mixing it with skim milk gives 38 grams of 16-amino acid protein per shake, so it's cost-effective, good quality, and gets the job done.

I originally wrote a review about there being no scoop when I first opened the jar, the scoop being essential to measure the amount of powder to use.I just took a long skewer and probed throughout the bottom of the 5 pounds of powder.  I hit an obstruction at the bottom of the large jar.  After much effort, I finally was able to fish out the ""missing"" scoop.Why the scoop was at the bottom is hard to figure.  I find it hard to imagine it simply ""settling"" there.  It should have been near or at the top of the powder.  Hopefully, the producer will place the scoop last in the jar at the top of the powder.  Sealing it in pouch would keep it empty and less likely to ""sink"".  Perhaps the pouch could also have an adhesive strip to adhere to the top of the inside surface of the jar.

I was recommended this product by a friend. I've tried a fairly small number of protein powders. I was looking for something that was even more budget friendly than Optimum Nutrition and to be honest, it's clear where Body Fortress either ""cuts corners"" or is simply delivering a slightly different product.First of all, it's worth noting that Body Fortress uses whey concentrate, not whey isolate like Optimum Nutrition. The primary difference here is that, as the name suggests, an isolate is an even more ""pure"" protein nutrient. What that means in practical terms is that you have to have more of it to get a similar amount of protein. So yeah, two hefty scoops is going to give you 60g of protein in one hefty shake... but it will also mean more calories, more fat and, perhaps most disturbingly, a TON of cholesterol.*That's fine if you want more of those calories, but the thing that I'm not a big fan of was just how much of the product I'm going through so quickly. Even though Body Fortress costs quite a bit less than O.N. you are using a much bigger scoop, so you're going through a larger amount of powder in less time. At the end of the day, you get a few more grams of protein but at an almost negligable price difference. I wish I had taken that more into consideration when buying it. If I ever have the desire to really bulk up, this might be a better option for me, but I already do a pretty good job -for me- managing macros without needing the extra fat contained here.To Body Fortress' credit, the powder mixes easily in milk or water, doesn't smell or taste bad. So for what it is, it's fine. there are some clear compromises/decisions made in this product that don't work for me, though.*odds are that if you are working out and doing lots of exercise you'll be okay, but for those using it as a more relaxed meal/calorie supplement, you will want to take that into consideration.

This protein powder tastes great and works fine. My issue with it is only that they advertise 60 grams of protein per serving, which seems better than competing products until you look at the serving size required to achieve that which is a ridiculous amount. A true metric should be grams of protein per specific volume of powder. But since none of the products out there make this easy to calculate, it would take a lot of time and effort to figure that out.So anyway, without wading into those shark-infested waters, the average consumer like myself is left with other deciding factors: cost and flavor. And that's what brought me to this product, and I will continue to use it until I find a better cost/flavor product. I'm guessing most whey protein these days is about on par when it comes to volume of product versus grams of protein. This one tastes good, and doesn't break the bank.

The main thing I want to write about is the flavor. I saw so many reviews saying the flavor was bad and it almost turned me off to buying this. The day I got it in the mail and made myself a drink, I used one scoop and about 8 oz of milk. Side note, the scoop was absolutely /buried/ in the powder, I had to dig around for five minutes to find it, thinking that they just forgot to include one. After mixing everything, I felt the result was way too thick (and a little chunky as well, which I couldn't get rid of just by mixing with a spoon.) In part due to the thickness, the result was a little sweeter than I wanted to stomach--keeping in mind that I tolerate less sweet than the average person. The other two times I've made it I added about an ounce or two more liquid (for one scoop), and today I used a smoothie cup to shake it instead of stirring, and both of those changes have made it great in my opinion.In the past, I've drank Muscle Milk, Koia, and others, and I find this to taste close to if not the best. I did a lot of math when looking at this versus other options, and for the amount of protein per serving and the volume of the product, it's really not a bad price. I think it was just slightly more than some other options and I was willing to pay a smidge extra for some of the qualities.

Holy cholesterol!  This stuff is rich.  It tastes delicious, and has the calories and cholesterol to match.  It's also super cheap, and mixes well with water, both of which are great.  As long as your workout is intense enough to burn off all the extra stuff you're taking in with this, I would recommend it. I've seen great results over the last month or so, but the workouts need to be intense.  I would not use this stuff for cutting weight, it's half-way to a mass gainer.  For putting on muscle though, this works well.

I've been using pretty much every brand of isolate, and I'm just sick of it. They taste bland and after buying over 10+ 5lb tubs over the years, you get sick of the watery flavor. People criticize this brand for having a ""misleadingly"" huge scoop, but the nutrition label clearly states how many scoops you're getting out of the container. Even purely on a protein/$ calculation, this brand is one of the cheapest per gram of protein. And let me tell you, it tastes way better than an isolate. it's like trying to eat a steak or burger that's 99% lean, yes it's healthier, but it tastes much worse. This powder will work much better for recipes etc. The better taste and sanity it provides is worth the extra grams of fat. The macros are still good at 200 cal and 30g protein per scoop, most protein powders need to be mixed with milk anyways to taste decent, but this one doesn't. It tastes like hot cocoa. Just heat it up and throw some marshmallows. You got yourself a healthier and sustainable treat instead of depraving yourself of taste in pursuit of the best macros. The only thing that tastes better is syntha 6 cold stone, but after finishing 3 different tubs, I'll be the first to tell you it's not worth it. those things give you gas unlike anything else, pretty sure it's the digestive enzymes they put in the powder, because nothing has ever come close to syntha 6 levels of gas. So just get this

I use it for the protein as I'm currently working out several times a week at the gym with the goal of bulking up (strictly for vanity, if the reason matters.)  It's hard to get enough protein to build that muscle without also consuming too many calories, so making a simple milkshake using this product before working out helps reach the daily protein goal without putting on fat.

This is by far the best value for money, and the flavor is unrivaled by other brands. I'm on my third container of it, and I haven't even considered switching brands due of the flavor and pricing. Others seemed to be complaining about their cholesterol levels. A single scoop contains 125 milligrams of cholesterol and 30 milligrams of protein. A single egg has 185 milligrams of cholesterol and 6 milligrams of protein. In that regard, it isn't awful at all. You can definitely find a better ratio, but it will almost certainly cost you twice as much. Others have complained about sucralose, an artificial sweetener used in Splenda. That's what gives it its distinctive flavor.

It would be nice to see the magnesium and phosphorus back in the formula though.  As far as gut effects, as long as your not eating it dry there's not rly any issues.

There are lots of useful reviews for this product. It is what it is - a protein drink. Their numbers are inflated compared to other products because they use multiple scoops, and when you take this into account, the product is similar to others on the market. So, if you like those other products, I think you will like this one.The only thing I can find that I do not like is the aftertaste. There is a sugary aftertaste after drinking the product, and it lasts for a long time. A very long time. Like, hours worth of time. I will drink the product (8oz of milk and one scoop of the product) at 9am, and that aftertaste is still with me at 11am and 12pm.

It still tastes like a protein shake guys, but the flavor is good. I personally throw mine in a cup post workout and stir it pretty quick with a fork and just drink it down in a gulp. Even with this minimalist method that rightly should have me choking on powder there are next to no clumps. I would bet if I put it through a blender like a person ought to, it would be silky smooth. The price to protein ration can't be beat either, and for how much protein is in there it is pretty low carb. Creatine being in there too just makes this an incredible deal. I actually rolled by a rack of this stuff in my local Walmart the other day for around the same price, so I like that I can pick it up immediately if I run out.

I will buy this again! First, the five pound size is a great value. Next, the packaging is thoughtful. This is a large container, so the fact that it is square, unlike the majority of containers which are round, allows the container to be neatly stored without wasting space. Finally, the flavor is good. I have chocolate and strawberry (in a two pound container) and enjoy them both. If the chocolate peanut butter is available in the five pound container, I will absolutely grab it!You can be creative with how you use the powder. I use a half serving always, because I am a female (I need fewer calories) and I am not using this to bulk up - just to get some nutrition and protein while watching calories. This is a fast, convent way to up the protein. I often have my half serving with one half cup or so of whole milk yogurt. If you enjoy frozen yogurt, then you will enjoy this as a healthy treat. I have mine fresh, but if you are patient you could freeze it before eating. Enjoy!

I’ve had a lot of protein powder in my 27 years around the sun. This does the job well, great for recovery after workouts and I take atleast 1 scoop a day minimum even in rest days. You can’t beat this product for value for money and quality. If you want a better quality protein powder pay the extra for it, but if you’re on a budget and just getting into training or have been lifting for a few years this is a decent quality “bang for your buck” product. Taste great with milk, water or other milk alternatives like oat milk. Good in cereal and yoghurt too.

I have to use protein supplement because I’ve had gastric sleeve surgery. I stumbled upon Body Fortress when it was the least expensive brand that provided the proper amount of protein per serving. I doubt that there is any brand that actually tastes like chocolate milk, let alone a milkshake, but Body Fortress tastes ok and works for me. When mixing with milk, I actually prefer the vanilla, as it tastes more shake-like and has less aftertaste than the chocolate. I’ve tried the strawberry, but didn’t care for it at all and ended up blending it with chocolate and vanilla to get rid of it. But tastes vary, so you may like flavors that I don’t. I mostly use the chocolate, and I usually mix it in decaf coffee. I make one pot (8 cups) coffee, one scoop of chocolate Body Fortress and one serving of Benefiber (I also have to take daily fiber supplements) and blend them together. I often add a touch of cinnamon and/or half of an overripe banana to add a little pizazz. A large dollop of honey really tops it off nicely. In summertime I make the coffee the night before I want to drink it and keep it in the fridge overnight for an iced coffee drink the next day. Hot or cold, it’s a great way to get the protein I need.

This is my first real serious use of whey. GR8 value, taste, and hunger curbing. I’m not working out hardcore, but moderately. Along with the protein powder, I’ve drastically changed my entire diet to lower my cholesterol, triglycerides, etc. I’m also trying to rebuild muscle I’ve let go in the last few years. After 3 weeks, I can see improvement in loss of some belly fat, a bit of definition in my torso and arms, and I feel pretty good. I subscribed to Amazon’s every two month delivery’s so I don’t run out, and I got 25% off the first order.  If you’re not committed to a specific brand of whey, I’d Rec recommend starting with this Fortress brand, which had good reviews as well as good value, taste, results, etc.

I really like this protein powder as far as taste and value go. I don't use it for working out but I am pregnant and have a meat aversion so getting my daily protein has been hard. I make a breakfast drink in the morning with one scoop and some almond milk and it's great. I really like the flavor/texture.Here's where it gets me. 60g protein per serving is only because the scoop is HUGE. I have never seen such a huge scoop in my life. If you truly used 2 scoops I feel like your drink would be the consistency of mud and not taste great. Its not because they packed more protein in the formula, it's the sheer volume they want you to use that makes the protein content so high. That's the only reason I take off one star.

I was using Orgain pea protein before but it’s so expensive, so I wanted to try a different brand. I couldn’t pass up the low price per ounce of this one. Now that I’ve tried this I won’t get it again. It tastes fine, like not much, but it gets SO FLUFFY and gross when blended that it’s hard to drink. And it’s suuuuuuper high cholesterol.

It's not as bad as everyone says. After a workout your muscles are basically screaming for protein. The body doesn't care where the protein comes from it just needs it in order to rebuild and expand muscle tissue. Having said that this is not the cleanest product out there and you will receive better results if you spend more money for a pure whey protein isolate. There are a lot of unnecessary ingredients in this product and the taste isn't the best (I tired the chocolate one, it was tolerable but not tasty). But if you are on a budget this product will do the trick.

Honestly, ive seen this product previously and just passed it up to get a vegan one, or a total isolate, etc.  I shouldn't have.  The price was low and i decided to check it out.  I wasn't expecting this to breath life into my nutritional approach to protein.  I use it for my morning shake that i make with berries and Greek yogurt.  It tastes flawless.  I use it for my multi grain Cheerios with almond milk.  The taste is just phenomenal.  I use it after my workout with water... Again, just perfect!  I have been using protein powders to enhance my diet and add to my protein intake for about 15 years, this is a great deal for anyone who's looking to be realistic about nutrition and supplement a healthy diet.  With low sugar, high protein, branch chain amino acids, gluten free for those on that lick, amazing flavor, and affordability... I recommend this for all ages and a realistic approach to a healthier lifestyle.

Likes:The square shape of the  container is way more convenient and friendly to store than the typical round shape of other 5 pound containers The cost is a great valueDislikes: I have purchased this brand several times over the last several years from the store. I agree that the “amazing new taste” does not taste good. It is worse than it used to be.Final Thoughts: I would recommend this and I would buy it again.  It is a great value. I honestly don’t care too much about the taste. I use this product for its nutrition, because I need protein, so the taste is kind of irrelevant.  It’s either this or prepare and eat a bunch of chicken. I’ll drink this no problem for convenience. It’s protein powder.

This stuff has always been my #1 pick and I 100% recommend it to anyone but just be warned that it will often clump up into little balls of unmixed powder if you plan on using more than 1 scoop in a blender bottle.

For the price, this stuff is pretty good. Hits the standard 30 protein a scoop like most other brands for a cheaper price. The taste of the Chocolate is among the best I've tried, I used 1/2 cup water and a tablespoon of PB Powder per scoop and some ice to make a killer PB Chocolate protein drink, thickens up just like a milkshake and isn't super watery like some other mixes, super delicious and filling after a workout.The issue with this product is the ingredients and the serving size, you get what you pay for. Like the other reviews said, there's quite a lot of Cholesterol and it has Malodextrin. If you're going low carb/Keto or looking for something pure protein, this has 17g Carb and 10g fat for 2 scoops which is pretty bad compared to other similar brands. The scooper/serving size is also gigantic so even a 5lb tub was lucky to last me about 2-3 weeks. Overall, a good product but I've moved on to other 'cleaner' protein powders.

I like it that it's dairy-free & low sodium. Below the ingredients it says it contains dairy. The only thing I could see being dairy is the cocoa. Any other non-dairy or even vegan protein powders tend be very high in sodium and/or sugar. This one isnt. I'm lactose tolerant. I have 0 issues with this, unlike Muscle Milk's non-dairy mix.Other protein powders I can drink mixed with milk or almond milk. This one actually tastes good with water. I can easily mix it with a spoon or mixer ball with water. It goes down smoothly, not thick. 5 pounds is very much worth the money. This was recommended by my trainer. Walmart sells the 2 pound size for the same price as this 5 pound on Amazon.

not bad but not amazing. I got the chocolate flavor and 90% of it mixed with the milk and the taste wasn’t bad. It was surprisingly good compared to how the other reviews said it was going to taste like. It has creatine in it which can go from 1.5g-6g depending if you only use 1-2 scoops and if you only drink it once or twice a day. If you’re just starting to go the gym and have a tight budget this might be you’re go to protein since it’s cheaper and also has creatine in it. If you don’t have a tight budget you might want to look into other protein. It also doesn’t come with a scooper so you will need a food scale to weigh it out.

One example would be BPI's protein powders, which delivered a burning sensation each time I slugged it down. This protein powder is the most delectable of all the ones that I've had.

I've had many different protein powders in the past, but when my preferred brand recently increased their prices, I decided to buy this Body Fortress brand. Every time after using it, even just 250 calories worth, it would lead to feeling bloated, as if gas was building up for some reason. Then for a few hours after, it would feel like I was almost about to vomit. I have never had such a problem before with protein powder, which is why I didn't think twice to buy this brand. I have dairy products all the time, I don't have any diet intolerances or medical issues.I didn't understand what was happening at first, thinking it was something I ate. But after stopping usage of this body fortress protein powder, the nausea and bloating went away. The only way I could continue using it was putting only 5 grams in at a time, and mixing it with another powder that didn't cause the bloating or nausea.I noticed another user named Glasco Whittaker had the same problem. I had the exact symptoms he described, especially the bloating. Very strange.Thus I can only give 1 star sadly. I do not write bad reviews lightly, but this protein powder really earned it.The chocolate flavor does taste way better than the vanilla, though. The new vanilla flavor tastes like medicine.

Good flavor - I've tried about a seven or eight other powders and this is pretty good as far as protein goes. Decent value in terms of protein per ounce. I think this one is putting on slightly more bulk than other powders, likely on account of the creatine, hard to say. It's not hurting anyway. Flavor is good, consistency is good, not too much of that protein bitter you sometimes have with these supplements. Probably in my top five, behind Isopure.In terms of results, I've been plateaued around 170 for a couple years, and recently increased my overhead lifts from 2x25lb to 2x40lb, right around the time I bought this powder. Since then I've put on about 9lb of muscle over two months, without making too many changes to the rest of the routine. Obviously, as this is only five pounds of powder, that didn't all come from the supplement, but at least it is supporting the additional reps well.

I have been using this protein powder for a month and I really like it. I use a blender to mix it with water, unsweetened almond milk or regular milk and no issues. I do not add any fruit or anything sweet since it will be to much for me, but occasionally I mix it with Nescafé and it is a different and good flavor. The container is huge. I'm happy with the item.

Overall, taste is not nearly as big of a factor for me as value and effectiveness. This has got to be one of the cheapest isolate dominant proteins on currently on the market. No other protein even comes close. Taste is pretty darn bad on the vanilla, haven't had the chocolate yet, but they definitely need to spend more money on r&d to improve the flavor.

The ingredients are similar to most and the protein (g) is on par as well. The parts I don't like are the container and the chalky taste. The bags and the zipper functions tend to not end well over the life of the bag so I prefer the tub. The chocolate taste isn't the best. There are definitely better tasting chocolates out there with comparable ingredients and as well as the nutritional elements. But, on sale, this is worth it if you can get it.

In general, I'm not picky when getting which kind/flavor of my protein. We use protein for protein. I grab whatever flavor that's on sale and I have tried so many across different brands and flavors.

I'm comparing this to the gold standard powder and to be honest I don't understand why they call this ""chocolate"". It tastes literally nothing like it.. It's almost like they got vanilla mixed up with chocolate or something. I know gold standard costs more but it also tastes MUCH better.

Every Protein Powder's reviews are overblown claims of how delicious they are.  Most I've tried range from fine, to pretty good.  Sometimes too plain, sometimes too sweet, sometimes too artificially sweet / after-tastey.  To me, they nailed it with this chocolate, because it has the perfect amount of bitterness inherent in real cocoa.  Best flavor of any protein powder I've ever tried.  The bag is a little messier than a cannister, but I transferred it, all good!

I haven’t been in the workout game in awhile! So I started with muscle milk products since I don’t want to get too slim but I also want to stay with some meat! I replaced this with a meal and it filled me up with confidence to not want to keep eating! I will keep getting this for the price until I know I will get more serious and keep up the good work!

I still remote first time I ever has some muscle milk, it was amazing.I don't know if they changed the recipe since then, but this product has a very sweet taste, not a rich flavor. I don't really buy my protein for the great taste but you can tell the sweetness when you drink this one.

I have drink many many varieties and muscle milk was one of those that stood out… long time ago. It was known for awesome flavor. But now days it taste very generic whey protein with too much sweetness and too much distortion in flavor. It begs the question… who is in charge here? Who decides how it should taste? It definitely isn’t the original muscle milk I remember and if you never had a chance, this is nothing compared. We all know we bought it for the price.Mix ability is among 5/10..  most cheap protein doesn’t mix at all so 5 of 10 is not that great. Best one mixes in smoothly but also higher in price.Flavor sucks. Get vanilla so you can mix it with something else. You get tired of its strong sweetness and something that suggests it’s vanilla. So taste it first with a small batch. Don’t just buy a 5lb one.Price… Knowing it’s not great, I rather spend 5 -10 more bucks for something else that I enjoy. Because reward will make good habits form.

I switched from O.N. Gold Standard to this to save some money. For context, I'm 6 ft/male/34/185 lbs/gym 3x a wk for 1.5 hrs.Here are my pros and cons:Pros: Same protein content as O.N., mixes well, affordable, 100% whey.Cons: Extremely sweet aftertaste of bubblicious gum. Although it's 100% whey, its a BLEND of isolate and concentrate, whereas O.N. is 100% isolate. in other words, the quality of O.N. is slightly better.Final thoughts: I think the 20$ savings make Muscle Milk better than O.N. overall. If you're a body builder, O.N. might be slightly better. For the majority of us that just want to look good naked, M.M. is the better product.

great product, it’s taste is definitely bearable compared to other protein powders, but i would 100% recommend adding more liquid than it says to. the instructions say to add 6-8 oz. of water, this will result in an overbearing taste (if you’ve ever eaten raw easy bake oven cookie mix… that’s what it tastes like).there’s lots of protein powders that taste a lot worse and there’s obviously infinite ways to make this delicious. just f around with it and see what works for you.great calorie count for the amount of protein you’re getting, and only 2g of sugar.for the price, this is definitely a gold mine for a gym rat.

The price of protein powder's exploded the last two years so I'm always on the hunt for good quality protein on the cheap. I used to buy strictly from Myprotein as they offered the best prices for high quality protein, but even with their 45% off code, they come out to roughly $10.60 / lb.With Muscle Milk's deals here, I picked up a 5 lb bag for $30. That's $6 / lb! And the taste is great as usual (I like to mix mine with milk in the blender).They have deals or coupons you can clip on here often, so highly recommend waiting for those to pop up.

One of the best value in terms of protein/price ratio. Would usually not complain but the taste is just horrendous. Imagine the most artificial ever vanilla flavor paired with a fatal amount of sucralose.Yes, I understand that people have genetically different tasting perception of sucralose, and I even liked sucralose before this. But this is just another level due to the sheer amount of it. I literally have to wash it down with extra water or I would feel the weird sweet aftertaste of sucralose in the next 2 hours.

I would not suggest this product to anyone based on a recent Clean Label Project investigation. 134 goods were evaluated for heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, and the toxin BPA in this study. Muscle Milk was one of the bottom five. However, the amount detected in the study was not published, so it's possible that it's little more than the amount found naturally in food. Because plants absorb these metals from the soil, the majority of the low-rated proteins were vegan. There aren't many reasons why whey protein should be at the bottom of this list. If I could get my money back, I would, but do your own research and make your own decision. They stick to plastic to avoid the additional BPA. This must change. HDPE can also be utilized, however it is less likely to be employed due to its higher cost as a packing material. We will update the review if new information on the study becomes available. Consumer Reports has published a review of this study.

I have been buying Muscle milk for years, easy to find and very affordable. My go to is the Chocolate. I typically mix with unsweetened Almond or Coconut milk. This latest shipment though, is different.  It has a new taste, almost like they added 100 packs of splenda or equal to it, and a much thinner consistency.  Not sure what happened, but its very hard to drink as a result.  I'm hoping that they didn't make a flavor change and that maybe I got a bad lot.  If this was my first time having Muscle Milk, i would never buy again based on the taste.  But I'll give them another shot one this bag is gone. If the overwhelming sweetness is still there next time, adios.

Originally bought because it was one of the cheapest per lb I could find.Unfortunately, it clumps a lot and is very hard to simply stir in with a spoon. Wish it used Stevia, a more natural sweetener, instead of the old school sweeteners in it.Not horrible, but will try another brand next time since I hate all the clumps.

Muscle milk told me this is the same as cytosport 100% whey commonly found in the big 6 pound bags at costco, now discontinued.The ingredients are similar but the product is not the same.The muscle milk product is no longer hydrolyzed or micronized as the costco cytosport was. You can recall the cytosport whey was an extremely fine textured powder which would blend very easily. While this is a much fluffier powder which mixes very clumpy, and no longer has the very fine, dust like texture the cytosport whey had.What happened was, they stopped hydrolyzing/micronizing the whey and instead added a lot more soy lecithin to the whey instead. Then, had the audacity to increase their prices for a lower quality product. Recall the cytosport whey was $40 for 6 pounds. Sold in a store. Meanwhile this product is $55 for 5 pounds. For an inferior, cheapskate product which stopped micronizing the whey and added more soy lecithin instead.The soy lecithin and acefulsame potassium in the product causes acne breakouts. The flavor is a much grosser much more chemical tasting whey than the old cytosport whey. They have decreased the quality, stopped selling in brick and mortar, decreased the size from 6 pounds to 5 pounds, yet despite all that, have RAISED the price.I needed that old cytosport i was used to and was willing to pay extra for it due to how well it digested and absorbed. But not like this. This is a harmful, dangerous product.  The company claims no changes were made to the formula or quality.I bought cytosport 100% whey in the 6 pound bags for literally 5 years straight. I used 2 scoops every single day. Went through a bag a month. It was obvious what was going on as soon as i tried this product and the reformulated cytosport product where the enzymes were replaced with probiotics. Suddenly, as soon as the product texture changes, it now starts bloating me after drinking it. Then i wake up the next day and i look bloated, face looks red, some acne is forming. No changes to my diet or supplements besides the whey suddenly being a different texture with a chemical taste and smell. It is very obvious what was going on. The cytosport 100% whey was a very consistent product from 2015 to april 2018. They shut cytosport whey down and switched over to muscle milk 100% whey sometime in mid 2018. This 100% whey has the same ingredients list as the cytosport whey, but not the same quality.  It is unfortunate as well as insane that they chose to lower the quality and servings of this product while raising the price.

Comparing to many other protein supplements, the ON WHEY Protein being on Top, this one ranks up the lowest.  The taste is fine but the texture is very water down like they just missed on some crucial ingredient to make it like other wheys out there.. The taste is very water down, well of course you still feel all the artificial sugars in there.. But for the last 5 months I ve been just comparing protein  powers to see which is really good for the long run...Ive been in working out for 5 + years and need a good protein supplement.. MuscleMilk is not it.. Also 2-3 months later it started clumping up and totally looks like ""wth is this in my cereal bowl"". So i took a pic.. Just know this doesn't happen in the first 3 months or so only after that.. Your milk and cereal just looks like it was water n cereal..  It really makes me further question this supplement company..  I would just stay away from using this product.. I think if you spend just little more and get the ON WHEY STANDARDS.. These guys never seem to fail in any way.. In fact it is the no 1 protein supplement as of right now..

For two years I tried different protein powders off and on. I went through brand after brand and found myself just forcing them down, the taste horrible. I was convinced that the protein powder experience was nasty sludge that people drank purely for the benefits, so I forced my way through each bag/tub.Not anymore! This protein is over the moon better! The flavor is tasty, the consistency is perfect, the nutrient profile is good, it all comes together to form the ideal protein supplement! I think the lack of maltodextrin is what makes this protein palatable. It has a taste and texture difference unlike all of the other maltodextrin-filled proteins I had tried before.If I could recommend a protein powder, buy this one!

I was beyond amazed with this protein powder. I got the vanilla flavored one and It doesn't not tastes chalky AT ALL. Is very sweet, but is a nice treat when you're craving sugary stuff (which is me every day). It didn't bring a scoop so i had to use one of my own and it turns out that 35gr are around 2 scoops of the i previously had so i recommend you to check the weight the first time you use it and then plan accordingly. Also, i used my milk frother to mix it it does take a while to get mixed but i used very cold water and maybe that had an impact on it. I definitely recommend this, specially if the person is starting to include a protein powder in their diet.

I just switched to this product because it is HALF the cost of the one I was using. It tastes OK for a powdered chocolate drink although it seems to have a slight additional taste sort of like they added a little vanilla. I prefer the taste of the previous product but I can't afford to pay twice as much per oz and this product comes fast and is in a 5 lb bag as opposed to a 2 lb jar. This one is .62 cents per oz while the other one I was using was $1.25 per oz. I'm 74, 6' 1"", 250 lbs and had a heart attack in Dec. I did 12 weeks of cardio rehab and was told I should get at least 200 grams of protein a day.

I started using protein shakes to supplement protein while lowering cholesterol. The problem is most of the protein shakes I see are high in cholesterol. The 100% whey protein shakes are lower but they don’t taste as good. I add a scoop of skim milk powder to make them taste better. Muscle Milk 100% whey protein shakes are very low in cholesterol when compared to regular muscle milk or any of the other protein shakes I’ve seen.

So my container was opened. I was a little alarmed, the lid was not fully closed but when I checked all around the seal was still intact, so I'm not sure why lid wasn't on properly but I've been using it. I got the cookies and cream and it really tastes like ice cream. When I opened it, I had to dig through for the scooper which is actually very large, this bottle won't last long if I'm planning to use it 3x/day, plus I only use 1 scoop to save it. Ill get the 30g of protein plus other protein from my meal. But I've mixed this with just a banana and some water and it tasted like a ice cream milk shake. Add some fruits or whatever else but I like that even with just the mix and water it still taste good. I have to see how it makes me feel after a good workout and the day after. Would buy again just for the taste though and with a decent meal it does keep me full.

I usually hate the taste of protein powder and this is no different, but this is the best I'd get from a protein powder besides the core power elite which has 42g of protein. That stuff is ridiculously good. This is very good for the price. I meal prep and don't like to rely on a powder to get my macros. This is perfect if you're short on protein and you're closing out a day of eating. I mix this with oatmilk(oatmeal has the worst texture and tastes gross) with banana baby food or sweet potatoe. I have a sweet tooth so this is perfect for me. I am low carb as well so this helps to have the energy I need for my 5x5 workouts because I don't use a preworkout.

This review is for Triple Chocolate 1.82# version, with TJ Watt as brand ambassador.I have been using different versions of this protein for years, and cycle through some other brands as well when I can get a good deal or flush with cash.This is my offseason, but still training and doing types of cross fit and homemade crazy workouts on the soccer field nearby, Peloton, lifting, rowing, etc.I need the protein to keep up, but  I don't need a 60 gram serving of protein smoothie at this time of the year. This protein mixes well for me (either on the run in a blender bottle or at home in a small individual blender) and doesn't clump on the sides or at the bottom. For me it also digests well and never gives me a headache (there is no aspartame in this version) or a stomach ache or any of the other unpleasant side effects from some workout bevs.The triple chocolate flave is, to me, delicious. I have it plain with almond or other plant milk, or even full milk for a treat, or throw in a banana or a half depending on size and some ice cubes if using the blender. Dessert for breakfast!One scoop = 30 grams of protein and for this size canister, there are 18 scoops.  The front of the package shows ""60 grams of protein"" but you would have to double up to get that, and the protein alone would be 360 calories, for those keeping track.I also bought several other canisters of strawberry, vanilla, etc. because they were a super deal over Thxgiving, but they have not arrived yet, and will review those separately.Will be buying again.

Seems like a deal because it's a big tub but to get the supplement values, you have to use two giant scoops of this stuff each time. Of course if you are looking for 30g protein Etc you can cut it in half but obviously all the other values are cut in half as well. I find it is grainy compared to my preferred brands, both with Shaker and mixer. Flavor is very good though, if you can Overlook grainyI didn't find it to be offensive to the old stomach but of course everyone's a little different there.When this tub was up, I went back to a different brand

Personally don't care about flavor or texture when it comes to supplements, and am no different with this.

After the big ""W"" retailer had been out of stock of vanilla whey, I decided to research other brands. I can't stand pea protein, and this was the most cost-effective brand across several brands. Overall, taste and scent are pretty comparable to other vanilla-flavored protein powders. It mixes well in smoothies and lasts a long time.

I bought 2 of these for just under $20.  This particular powder includes Zinc and Vitamin C. I don't need a ton of protein, so these 2 jars should last for 1 or 2 months. Of course, I prefer a 12 eggs per week (and less powders) but at around $5 per dozen I am cutting back.

My husband and I try and eat our weight in protein everyday day, but some  of the protein powders are crazy expensive and not very good in the taste department. This is not the case with this brand I absolutely love this protein powder. We get the strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla and they are so good! They are lower in carbs, sugar, and a very good price. Will keep ordering and if you’re looking for a good protein powder go with this one!

So after using the Cookies and Cream Whey Protein from Body Fortress for quite a while I decided to try out the same flavor from Six Star cause it was in stock and cheaper and holy cow this stuff is way too damn sweet. Like feels like you're just dumping sweetener in your mouth. Yeah it tastes a little like Cookies and Cream but it's so sickeningly sweet you'll not pay much attention to the flavor. The Body Fortress brand is far superior when it comes to the Cookies and Cream flavor as it actually tastes like Cookies and Cream without the gallon of sweetener with it. Overall it's not horrible but I would recommend getting a different flavor or going with a different brand for the same flavor.

I bought several different flavors of these when I started my gym routine. I've been going for about 3 months, and it's effective. 30g of protein per serving, plus whatever your liquid is (skim milk for me), and additional fruits/veggies. It does the job, and it is cheap in terms of price per ounce.My only complaint is it's too sweet, particularly the vanilla cream. Triple chocolate is a bit on the sweet side, and strawberry is way way too sweet.

When you buy whey protein thats not 100% isolate to save some money, you (and me) have made a bad decision right there. The foul taste breaks through even fruit drinks crappy tasting protein doesnt break through.If you want to save some money and dont mind a slight, but natural, taste to your unflavored protein, then go for a whey isolate, casein mix (not casein alone or you’ll be going down the same ‘ugh’ taste road when you take your first sip of your shake that was just ruined.A little higher price, but 100% whey isolate, no matter what brand, is the way to go

This is my second time trying protein powder. I had a vanilla flavored one previously and I got sick of it very quickly, even after switching to adding coffee powder to it.

For anyone complaining about the taste, they probably haven’t tried many protein drinks. As far as protein drinks go, this is one of the best tasting (I’ve only tried strawberry). Be aware that the instructions say to stir, shake or blend. You can’t stir it because it’ll be terribly lumpy. Even shaking left some significant lumps. I use a nutri-bullet blender and that does a pretty good job but still leaves some gritty residue on the bottom of the glass. If the flavor is still a concern, what I do is keep a pint of strawberries in my fridge and toss a few in before blending. As for it’s claims that it builds muscle faster, I cannot verify them. I’m pretty thin and need to build mass. I’ve been using the product for about 2 weeks and all I can note is that I have increased my weights when lifting but that could be natural progression of the regimen. And I haven’t gained any weight. I’m still pretty early in the process so it’s possible some changes could be evident in the future. There would need to be analytics based on several factors so I’m not sure that anyone could say for certain that this product delivers what it guarantees. But my overall assessment is that it tastes decent and if nothing else, appears to keep my energy up throughout the day. I’ll likely keep using it just for the creatine and protein.

So I held off from writing a  review until I had tried it every which way I could or was recommended. I ordered the Vanilla Flavor and the Cookies & Cream flavor. My concern with this stuff is always the flavor because I know what the nutrition facts are since they are printed on the package itself so whether they are true or not there they are, but flavor is different for everyone. They can say ""greatest tasting ever"" or ""america's number 1 tasting protein.."" but you can only know once you try it yourself. As for me I can easily say this has a really great taste to it I'm really loving it, the way I like to make mine is 8-10 oz of water per one scoop, any more water than that and it doesn't taste as good unless I add another half a scoop, it's the same for both flavors. Although the best taste definitely comes when you add a little milk to it. When I tried it with milk I had 4 oz of milk with 8 oz of water and one scoop of the powder and mixed it in a mixer and woooow the flavor was amazing! I used 2% milk since I had ran out of 1% just in case you were wondering. When I'm using this at home this is definitely how I'll be making them always it was really good, as for the gym I don't have access to milk so I'll have to stick to water there. As for results I'm not sure yet I just started using this for about 5 days since writing this review I'll have to get back to you all on that, but yes this does taste really good it all depends on how you like to prepare it for yourself and if the nutrition facts are true this protein powder is a real winner! oh and I recommend mixing, I had practically no clumps when I stirred it as opposed to shaking it, that is of course if you have something on hand to stir it with.UPDATE~~~  I've now tried all the flavors they're all great but my least favorite definitely has to be the triple chocolate

I have tried so many different protein shakes, I can't even remember the names of some of them. Typically what I am looking for in a protein shake, is naturally, the amount of protein, lower calories, and taste. More recently, I discovered that some protein shakes include glutamine in them, which saves me the hassle of having to take another supplement. I originally bought a protein formula from GNC that contained glutamine (it was an impulse buy) and when I went to buy it again, was unwilling to pay another $60 for it. So after some research, I bought this from Amazon.The taste is actually the first shake I have ever been able to mix with just plain water. It also mixes a lot better in water and doesn't get all clumpy. Naturally, I assumed it would taste even better with milk, but just the opposite, it tastes like really heavy cake frosting (the french vanilla flavor), which makes me want to vomit after a heavy work-out session. Most other protein shakes, I have to mix with milk because of the taste and they typically clump more in water, but I hate getting those extra calories from milk, especially when I am trying to stay away from dairy. So this is awesome for just mixing in water, which is also great when you are on the go.Finally, I am no expert on the amount of glutamine I have to take to experience the anti-soreness characteristic that is so awesome, but the amount that is in the serving size is just perfect. I can definitely tell the next day if I have not taken this shake as I am sore to point of it hurting to move the muscle group, and generally more out of energy. When taking the shake post-workout, I am still a little sore the next day, but more in the sexy feeling 'I-worked-out-and-my-muscles-feel-really-big-and-strong' kind of sore. So for a decently priced, decently tasting, decent protein shake with glutamine, you should definitely get this.

I been looking for another protein brand but I have not been able to switch you can not beat 32g per scoop, overall pricing ranging from 20$-30$ certain pharmacy and grocery store sale it quite high, dependable online is your best bet, i was once a skeptic that I relied so much on the protein powder to gain some sort of muscle mass, but in reality it’s through consistency, hard work, and determination, that really pays off, protein powder is just to assist you if your incapable of meeting your macros, and help you in replenishing what your body requires in order to build and grow that sometimes your incapable of obtaining by consuming food, it does contain a certain amount of creatine witch at first I was extremely scared to intake but in order to have such an impact for an individual you need to intake about 5g a day of creatine so overall ladies this is not bad, Regardless of anything with or without creatine your body still retains water through what you consume, you more than capable to find a supplement or a form of food to balance out your ph levels, I been taking this protein for about 3 1/2 years going on four and do not seem to find anything else other than this1-affordable2-great taste3-proper nutrients4-good amount of proteinI honestly can not complain I mix it as a smoothie, oatmeal dependable of what I’m craving through out the dayHappy lifting guys

I've been on SS protein for a few years now, strictly Isolate during the day and the regular whey at night before bed. I have absolutely zero complaints about SS protein, this newer flavor just widens the ability to change things up for me. It mixes fine whether manual in a shaker or even my weaker Farberware Blender. It's a great base to additives such as peanut powder, various milks and milk substitutes, even snack bars (try half of a Nutri-Grain or even the softer Nature Valley Granola bars in the blender with it). It has everything I've needed, presently need and will continue to need. I was regularly getting deferred back in mid-2014 for low protein counts whenever I hit my local plasma donation center. It was about a month after I started taking SS that I was hitting my numbers easily. This could be a meal replacement, I'd go 10oz+ and go a full 2 scoops if you're going that route.Early April 2017 Update: This continues to be my pre-bed protein, 2 nights every week I cut it with an 8 hour sustained release protein since I donate plasma the next morning.Late April 2017 Update: I have absolutely nothing but immensely positive things to say about this. It's not a rant or rave, it's a protein that just plain works for me. I have zero issues and still....zero complaints.Mid-November 2017 Update: This has been a staple in my cabinet and 4 year running diet (more maintenance at this point). I have absolutely nothing but positive things to say about it. I admit to using it as meal replacement frequently, but with my schedule and strictly zero-fast-food policy this is exactly what my body needs. 3/4 flavors are a 10 with me, chocolate is a few ticks lower, not the fault of Six Star more personal preference, but the few times I've had it the results were 1:1 on par with the other 3 flavors.

-How do you use this product?Generally I take 1 scoop per workout and occasionally I'll take it on an off day when I do cardio or something light like pushups etc.-What similar products have you used, and how does this compare?Before buying this I tried GNC's Whey Isolate here: http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2986026It costs almost 3 times as much as this product, but I enjoyed taking it and the results much better. Is it worth the price hike? probably not, but one should find something as good for a cheaper price.-What should other customers know when considering this product?Consider what you are buying a product like this for? Do you need the cheapest price/oz protein supplement and don't care what its like? You might want this.Do you want really high quality results and something that tastes good? This probably isn't for you-What aspects of this product do you like or dislike?The one good part about the product is that it does provide some protein supplement (it should right?) and doesn't taste ""too bad"" for that.The bad part is that it mixes terrible with milk. I ended up mixing it with double the recommended amount after awhile just to make it mix better, but for the most part I am eating a chalky milk mixture at the end of the day. The chocolate flavor by itself isn't terrible, but when it doesn't mix well, it tastes awful.I can't comment on how well it mixes with water, but if you are used to mixing it in a blender with other things and turning it into a smooth, you are fine. It mixes just find in smoothie form. It is only with plain milk.*EDIT* After buying a mixing bottle, I decided to make a minor edit to this review. I can say if you are using a mixing bottle (with the spiral mixing ring inside), it does mix *slightly* better. I would still recommend another product, but if you do use this one, I would say use more milk then recommended and use a mixer.-Was the quality of this product above or below your expectations?For the most part it was below. However, considering I only paid 18 dollars at the time, I probably should't complain much

I originally found this product at my local grocery store but for a much higher price. I like to put this in my coffee every morning. It tastes great and mixes easily. I put it in a quart Mason jar with 1/2 water and 1/2 coffee and blend it with a wire whisk. It was a game changer for me when I made the decision to change to a healthier diet and lose some weight. It gives me a good amount of protein and I don’t feel hungry for 7-8 hours. If I don’t set a timer to remind me to eat a light lunch, I won’t even think about it. I use it to make high protein waffles for the kids. They love the taste and will eat them plain or dip them in yogurt or peanut butter for breakfast, snacks or even “breakfast for dinner”. They love them and it’s so easy for me because I can make a big batch, keep them in the fridge and warm them up in the toaster.

I haven't tasted yet, but the left is from a few months ago purchased at Walmart. The right is from Amazon which is 4 percent less protein per scoop. A bit Lower in calories. No BCAA information. I might change to higher or lower review depending on taste. And last time I purchased at Walmart it was 17.50. But I'm sure they've raised the price as well.

I originally ordered the triple chocolate protein.  I wanted to reorder so I did not run out.  This is really good.I wanted to order the same thing at the same price, but  even with the ""review your orders,"" I was having difficulty finding it!  Finally, I saw it in one of the SMALL pictures.  I was so happy and immediately thought I was reordering it.  My granddaughter had wanted to try it, and I let her open the package.  I was shocked when she said dismayed, ""Cookies and Cream?  I HATE oreos!""  I know!  I would return it, but it was MY error. I truly thought I was getting triple chocolate again.  I will try to use it, but it certainly isn't a flavor I would have knowingly ordered.  I now know this comes in several flavors.  If you see one you like, I would recommend the product, especially the 'triple chocoIate!' I like it in my hot coffee.

I am looking at this product from a strictly 'added protein' perspective.  Not dieting, not working out, just do not eat well enough to get what I need so i supplement and add stuff to smoothies.  This has a great flavor and a slight sweetness that i like.  It costs less than what they sell in the store and you get a LOT!  If you are older, and don't need a lot of protein, or eat enough in your diet that you just need a bit more, do not use the giant scoop that comes with it.  Figure out how much you need and use a smaller scoop that will supply your needs.  It lasts a lot longer that way and you do not get More protein that you should have.  Yes, you Can get more than you need and that will go to fat too!  Did you know that?  I don't think that is legal, is it? (Like birthday cake should Never be fattening).Anyway, I have this on my buttons and on my honey list, so I can get it when it is down and not up.  You should try it and see how great it is.

I bought this product hoping to have something different then the general vanilla and chocolate protein shakes I have become accustomed to. Now I see why it was so cheap - it is absolutely inedible. I could not take more than a few sips before throwing it out. It is SO sweet. I consume sugar on a regular basis and this was still sooo sweet I could not manage. I tried going to Amazon and the product support page to ask about a return or replacement but could not get through the red tape of the return policy to even speak to someone. Buyer beware, do not buy the Cookies and Cream flavor.

59 YEAR OLD FORMER COMPETITIVE BODYBUILDER IS PROMULGATING... LISTEN UP! Six Star Whey Protein is as good as any, and better than most. It's made by industry giant Muscletech and renamed Six Star just to get it in Walmart at an affordable price. One scoop gives you 30 grams of protein, 2.5g creatine and good helping of BCAA's. I've been in the gym for 42 yrs, so I've been around the block a few times. I once attended a bodybuilding seminar given by Boyer Coe. He told us straight out that 90% of what you read in the muscle mags is BS, so don't get caught up in all the hype about all of these expensive proteins being offered out there. Just go with Six Star...it's more than adequate. Remember, it's all about the training and genetics. Train hard, train smart and train consistently. There are alot of pros out there that are pushing all kinds of supplements. What they aren't telling you is that they are taking HGH, Deca, synthetic testosterone, Winstrol, etc... If you want to get big and stay healthy, all you really need is Six Star protein, CLA, preworkout, boron, zinc and a miltivitamin. If you are over 40, add D-Aspartic acid. Oh yeah, and train like a man possessed. I'm in the process a formulating a homemade preworkout that costs 65 cents a serving. One serving will blow your socks off..stay tuned. Stay hungry, my friends!

I have enjoyed using this protein.  It has a great taste and mixes really well.  I do not get clumps using a shaker bottle.  I really like the fact that it has some research behind it, and that they have added BCAA's and other essential elements.  You could consume all the protein in the world, but if something is limiting the absorption of it, then it will not do you any good.  I feel like this protein has research behind it and some of the added ingredients to maximize protein utilization.  I feel like it is working for me.I keep coming back to this protein, and have purchased it multiple times now.  I have tried the cookies and cream along with the triple chocolate.  The cookies and cream is good, with a strong vanilla taste.  I think I would recommend the triple chocolate for your first purchase.  Anyway, I take this protein as a recovery drink after my workout, and it really helps.  Since taking this protein I have upped my workouts from 5 to 6 a week.  I think this protein is helping my recovery so that I was able to increase my workout volume.

My first time using six star protein, but not my first time using six star products. 30 grams of protein per serving are decent, I try to use just one serving per day since I have a high protein diet anyway and I want this tub to last a bit longer. I gave this one four stars because of one ingredient, sucralose. the taste of the artificial sweetener is strong with this mix. So far the only flavor I have tried is the triple chocolate, I will try the other flavors and update this review as I do. The servings recommend 4 to 8 ounces of water/milk but the scoops are so big I don't use less than 8 ounces per scoop. Pros and cons;ProsDecent amount of protein per servingAffordableMixes really well in the blender bottle, never have any clumps with cold milk or water,ConsSucralose, yuck. If not for that the the taste would be pretty good.Edit 8/28/2014: I could not get past the sucralose taste so I didn't finish my first tub. I have switched to a different brand of protein and won't be trying any more flavors of six star protein unless they change their ingredients in some way.

Rated one star because you can't give negative stars.  I have been a loyal customer since that Consumer Reports study that found Six Stars among the lowest in heavy metal contaminants, of the protein supplements that were tested several years ago.  Since the product has changed dramatically since then I am no longer sure that is still the case.  What is certain is that Six Stars has decided its customers need massive doses of Calcium - 555 mg!!!! - and this in addition to 190 mg of Iron that I didn't ask for.  Both calcium and iron supplementation can cause constipation.  If you mix this chocolate flavored chalk with milk, like most of us do, that's another 300 mg. or so.  I had no idea what was causing my constipation so I tried a lot of things, laxatives gave me explosive gas, temporary watery relief, then back to dry black hard stools, and very rare bowel movements - but still lots of gas.  I also tried probiotics, especially Activia - my use of Activia may have done more harm than good since it also contains a lot of calcium.  Factor in your multivitamin or other calcium containing supplements if you take one, and any dairy you eat or drink, and any other calcium containing foods and you are ingesting a mega-dose of Calcium, almost certainly way more than you need.  If you take Tums for heartburn like me you might as well seal your exit with crazy glue, you may never crap again.This is a product marketed to healthy men primarily, who specifically do not need massive amounts of Iron or Calcium.  The amounts are indefensible, though I am aware high doses of protein may increase calcium excretion a little, this is just a ridiculous amount, and I can attest to the ill effects it will have on your bowel.  They should add a warning label.  I thought I must have colon cancer or an intestinal blockage.  Stopped taking this crap - NOW has a good supplement with no additives, that's my new priority in protein supplements.Also this contains articulate sweeteners that may also be harmful if used on a regular basis.P.S. Since I recently stopped this I had a dramatic reversal of symptoms, may have pooped out 3 days of buildup just so far today.  When you're constipated you have no appetite - because you're literally full of you know what - and you feel stale and run down all the time.  Never thought I'd be so relieved by something so mundane.

This has one less star for taste vs. Muscle Milk. That's the only detraction.I use protein as recommended by my doctors, and friend who is an RN and nutritionist as part of healing severe physical conditions related to illnesses and surgeries. I also use it to get the best out of my workouts. I now rely on this also by finding this is wonderful for helping with my appetite and blood sugar balancing, additionally being a part of healthy GI and correction of IBS.I practice yoga on a near daily basis (and have built incredible upper body strength quickly, likely thanks to supplementing with this as well) and also lift weights on a regular basis.I find that some whey protein mixes or supplements can give exacerbate my IBS/GI conditions to extremes but this is gentle on the stomach and helps me with dietary management. I mix with water or ice usually but sometimes add to smoothies. This has an advantage over my first choice of Muscle Milk because of the content of protein per scoop and calorie content.This is a staple in my daily functioning and I have it on auto-ship.

This stuff works. I've been using it for years. Great results within a week of regular exercise without having to overpay for the same thing at GNC and the like. You can also buy this brand at WalMart as well as body fortress but having tried both I like this ones results better. The taste is not bad. I won't over compliment it buy saying it tastes amazing or whatever like some of these other reviewers but it tastes ok. Almost good even. I'd recommend the vanilla honestly. But all the flavors are pretty good. Directions say to drink it an hour before or after exercise but I see lunkheadsin the gym drink it during. I've experience results following the directions. Just practice self restraint and follow the directions. You can also drink some when u wake up as well as an hr before or after for even faster results. Oh and I also recommend spending the extra 6 or 7 bucks to buy a blender bottle with this here on Amazon cuz I'm telling you the markup in retail stores is at least 40% you will find the blender bottle at its cheapest here on Amazon and its perfect for mixing this with. I don't recommend the spoon stir method. It just doesn't feel mixed all the way no matter what if u do it that way. Buy a blender bottle you'll be glad u did.

Good enough to purchase.  Not good enough to overpay for.  I have used this product for at least 7 to 8 years now and will continue to buy.  I only get Vanilla and it tastes decent but is just a little too sweet. Its is affordable at $18.99.  I only take one scoop a day after workouts.  I am not a body builder, I just like to lift weights, and get straight, till its time to ball.  I am 43 now and about 6 ft tall and am just looking to maintain my 200 lb stature.  I feel that 1 scoop immediately after a workout helps me keep in shape and aids with muscle recovery.  I also eat alot of protein everyday as well.  Steak and beer man from Texas if yall know what i mean.  So yeah I like this stuff.  Its for everyday people.  Gym nerds and bodybuilders probably need a little higher quality, but this good enough for me.If the price was $22.00 however, I would go without........

Ok. I’m skinny by standards, and I try to gain weight and work out. I always felt like I got nowhere. So I research the best tasting protein shake to try to see if having more protein and whatever might be healthier. First off, it tastes excellent.Perfect formula: 4 ice cubes, 1/4 cup of assorted frozen berries, 8 oz of water, 1/4 banana. Two scoops.Perfect shake.  I hated these things, I even drank muscle milk for years thinking it was a good idea.  So I like this. I’m finally over 150 pounds from 140 ish after drinking one a day for two months and working out daily during quarantine. But recovery time is super fast. One day of rest and I’m back at it. Goes down easy.

I received a defective product. When I attempted a return, Amazon directed me to the manufacturer. The manufacturer told me to return it through Amazon. When I explained that Amazon had sent me to inquire with them directly, they told me they can't accept returns from outside sources. Six Star doesn't stand by their products and they have set up a catch-22 return policy so that the customer has no recourse should something be wrong with the product.

Seems like a really great mix, always really liked 6-STAR.It's  interesting that if the ACTUAL COST PER SERVING is computed (based upon the purchase price paid), my actual Cost Per Serving was $1.19.... which  is actually +$0.03 more per serving than with the (seeming more costly) competing MuscleTech Platinum 100% Iso-Whey product. (Completely surprised me!🤓! ).This product does have 30g of protein per serving, versus only 25g. per serving in the MuscleTech  protein product.  Additionally, the MuscleTech jar's net weight is 1/4 pound less, but the per-serving scoop size is lighter/smaller,  but, the purchase price is way higher.Packaged net weight of this product is 1/4 pound more, but, even with it's lower purchase price, it has a bigger scoop size which holds  approx 53.8g., versus, only just a little over 37g. per serving weight w/MuscleTech scoop!For the sake of comparison, the ""ACTUAL"" cost per serving is approx. exactly the same! (I'm glad, I bought both brands.)So......Go figure!  ""6 of 1, and a half a dozen of the other""....... But now I just wish someone could confirm which one is actually the best!!🤓🙄😱

Over the years I've tried most of the protein powders on the market and this one has the benefit of being one of the least expensive and by far the best tasting one I've found.  I also love that 30 seconds in a shaker will actually fully dissolve the powder so I'm not choking down clumps of dryness as is so often the case with other products.  And with 20g of whey protein and just 2g of sugar it's got the key ingredients I'm after without alot of what I try to avoid.  Tasty way to get some extra protein into your diet.

I'm a skinny guy and it's really hard for me to gain weight, muscle or fat, so I can abuse a little on the calories I consume, so I don't care that only 20g of the 36g each scoop I ingest are really protein, but if I was counting calories I would go for something leaner.Still, why I chose this one? because the price is better than others and those extra carbs give the shake a nice creamy texture and flavor that a low carb protein shake won't have.I'm satisfied with this one, I'm supplementing it with leucine to get the best of it. Results? not different than having a piece of steak, but it's less smelly and more convenient for my early morning training, steak is for the evening!

Out of 5 or 6 different protein powders I have tried, this is the best tasting and most smooth and easily mixed one.  Many people gave negative remarks because they said it did not come with a scoop.  Mine did.  You just have to take the time to look for it as it gets buried in the powder just like it does in every protein powder.  This is a great product, especially at this price.

It's sooooo delicious and I'm sad I can't drink it anymore. I think it's because of the whey and other dairy ingredients in it because it made me breakout like crazy.

I needed to supplement my diet to heal from major surgery. I bought this to add to my scratch homemade chocolate pudding to give me extra nutrition in addition to the necessary calories. I thoroughly mixed the whey protein powder with my dry pudding mix then put in the milk before cooking. It tastes great and has a smooth texture. I did have to add some additional liquid (milk and/or coconut milk) to thin it a little after cooking it and adding vanilla. I will definitely keep this is my pantry.

I’ll shake mine with lactose free whole milk, and put in the fridge to get super cold, shake again and it’s smoother than Amish butter on rye bread!It tastes so so SO good!

Ok first things first. Some people are allergic to maltodextrin, which this has a load of in it. It's simmilar to a dairy allergy, just use xertec for example and it should help a bit. Maltodextrin is basically a type of corn starch that isn't healthy but works great for packing on calories, overall just check if it makes you sick by just having a scoop and mixing it with milk. If you feel like a bums gonna go SPLAT, then get some dairy pills or offer it to a friend as a prank, nobody dies from this it's just kinda ""crappy"" torture lol

Added one scoop to 12oz of skim milk, mixed well in the shaker bottle. Only a slight aftertaste, definitely not as bad as other powders for the aftertaste(comparing to PureProtein powder). Tastes almost like chocolate milk, minus the aftertaste. A good addition to my meal planning. Seems to be helping to keep full.Update after trying with Vanilla Almond Milk: tastes even better, no aftertaste. Might take a little more shaking in a shaker bottle but i only say that because some powder was stuck on the lip of the drinking spout. Which happens occasionally with skim milk too.

I bought this because what I usually order wasn't available and I didn't want to wait until the end of the month to get it. I took a chance on this because the price was decent and people in the reviews said how great it tasted. I personally don't think it tastes that great. It's not bad, but it's not great. What I usually buy, Integrated Supplements Whey Isolate Protein Powder, tastes way better. But it's servicable.

Not bad for the price, scarce are the protein powders under 1$/serving. Also has little cholesterol compared to others that have 20-30% daily cholesterol intake. Only thing I liked about it besides the price is the taste. Protein profile is whey concentrate, which isn't bad, but there are better options out there. Mixabilty is its greatest flaw, if you are putting in cold milk or water, there will be lots of clumps, even after whisking it. Mixes fine with warm water...For the price it's decent, I use it when I run out of my go to whey, Iso sensation by ultimate nutrition...

I tried a protein powder from a different brand last time and my GOD was it disgusting. It smelled awful, it made me gag at every tiny sip, and clumped like crazy. I was very nervous to try this one because of that experience.Firstly, it’s true, it really doesn’t clump. It’s as smooth as it can be.Second, it doesn’t make me want to gag, and it actually tastes GOOD. I can actually see myself drinking this each day.I cannot speak on the effects yet, since it’s the first day I’ve used it, but it’s promising so far.

I'm using this at 5g a dose as a flavoring agent. The ingredients are not that clean, too many gums and emulsifiers. The flavor is sub-par compared to 5 other chocolate protein powders I've tried.

As an avid lifter, I have been on different types of protein shakes before and all of which usually had that same protein taste regardless of how much flavoring was in it. I also noticed myself getting tired of having those over-flavored shakes and also the bloated feeling that came with them as well. This is hands down the best protein I have ever been on period. If used daily after a workout like most people do you will definitely see gains in your muscle mass and physique. Obviously, dieting is hugely important when it comes to weight lifting and looking good but if you want to put on some lean muscle without dreading having to drink a protein that will mess with your stomach or taste buds this is the one. In a matter of 6 months working out 6 days a week eating clean, cutting, and pushing my thresholds I was able to turn 20 pounds of fat into 20 pounds of muscle. I have done this several times now as iv been on this protein for over 3 years and counting. If you are taking your workouts seriously and constantly pushing yourself your body will reward you for buying this protein. Also, I never get bloated after an entire shaker cup with two scoops and milk and that's amazing to me. The only con I have is that the price used to be a lot more affordable when i first started using it but honestly its worth the money so I don't even bother switching

I have been using this protein for a year and a half. It is by far my favorite. It is high quality and mixes into liquids well without making your drink too thick, and no gritty powdery texture. However, the price has increased from $72-$99. And I recently got a new container of it and the flavor of the vanilla is not the same. My one complaint about this product was that it was a little too sweet, and now I would say it’s not sweet enough. They must have reformulated, but it would be nice if the sweetness level was right in the middle of the old and the new formula. Also, it makes your breath pretty bad so always brush your teeth and tongue right after.

The ON platinum may be more expensive than other brands, but just remember, you get what you pay for.  After bariatric (GB) surgery, my doctor said I needed 60 grams of protein a day.  A lack of protein after GB results in hair loss, fatigue and muscle wasting.  I only rarely ate meat pre- GB, and even less now.  I began to have the classic symptoms, with the hair loss and fatigue being the worst.  With GB restricting meal size to itty bitty portions, and not being a huge meat-eater, I was desperate to find a way to get enough protein daily.  I tried just about every other brand of protein powder on the market with unpleasant results.  They were impossible to dissolve in liquids, stayed lumpy, had an off-taste, were gritty in the mouth, and were low in the amount of protein per serving.  After reading a magazine article about any contaminants or heavy metals found in commercial protein powders, it looked like ON was one of the safest, so I ordered the platinum hydro-whey in vanilla.  Wow.  No off-taste, it's whey (the best source), and one serving (one scoop) is a whopping 30 grams of protein.  When you first add it to liquid, it appears that while it mostly dissolves (hydrolyzed?), there are a few small lumps.  Just do a very little stirring.  Even so, I can't detect any lumps or grit when drinking it.I hope this helps fellow GB-ers in need of protein sources.  GB is life changing, and finding adequate protein has been a real challenge for me.  I'm not a morning person and can't handle a big breakfast.  A morning drink made with ON works for me and supplies me with half of the protein I need all day.  But you can have them any time you want.  Yes, my hair loss started stabilizing and is getting better.  My fatigue is improving.  I had really gotten myself down a hole 6-9 months after GB surgery, and I don't expect miracles overnight, but I'm really seeing my health improve after getting more protein in my diet.  I'll give my basic recipe for a ON protein drink, but you can try many variations on it.  Good luck to you all in your weight loss and health journey.In an 8 to 16 oz. mug or glass, add 1/2 cup more or less of water.  Add a teaspoon or two of instant coffee crystals (I use Folger's classic roast) and stir.  Add 2 to 4 squirts of Torani sugar free syrup.  Add one scoop of ON and stir.  Add more liquid to taste.  This can be more water, milk (low fat for less calories), coffee and milk, coffee, or?  I then like to add a couple of ice cubes, but that's optional.  The variations on this can be endless.  Use coffee or not.  Use milk or not.  Use Torani or not.  Try different Torani flavor combinations (1/2 caramel and 1/2 vanilla is good).  Vary the amounts/portions of any of the ingredients to taste.  I don't use any measuring cups or spoons now for this.  Less dirty things to wash and the measurements don't need to be exact.  Whatever glass or cup is handy, a spoon out of the silverware drawer and available ingredients, and a scoop of ON.  I haven't tried fruit juice yet, but was thinking that OJ and low fat milk (no coffee) might be creme-sicle-ish.  GB-ers be careful to check the grams of sugars in juice servings.  Not sure if Torani makes sugar free OJ syrup, but I know they make some sugar free fruit flavors.After running out using the small ON container size, I now order the 3.5 pound size and keep a spare on hand.  ON doesn't seem to be available at many retail stores, so Amazon is the best source I've found for speed and best price.  When I occasionally run out of ON and fill in with something else in a pinch - Yuck!

When I was setting up an ""Insanity"" workout schedule back in the late summer (which I had to leave off once allergy season started), I researched and bought a number of different health-shake related products. The short version of this review is that I tried ON's Platinum Hydro Whey first, as a supplement to the P90X formula; eventually ran out of it; tried the other things I bought; and am now giving them away to go back to this!Being somewhat lactose intolerant, I worried that a pure milk product would be a problem, but decided to risk it due to the hydrolyzed state. Perhaps because of that I never once had a problem with this product. (And I see some other reviewers didn't either, although some have in fact had stomach cramps, so apparently it depends on the personal biochemistry. Buyer be warned. UPDATED TO ADD: as of early September 2012, the product now contains a slight amount of lactose. Not enough to bother me, but could be problematic for other people.)I bought the vanilla version (also in other products) specifically for the purpose of adding some protein and now-missing vanilla flavor back to the new version of the P90X Recovery Formula drink. As many people here will be aware, this was a very popular drink in its original incarnation, largely due to its strong mixture of vanilla and orange flavors. The new version tastes more like Tang, but lacks the sugar and vanilla flavor to hide the vitamin/mineral aftertaste.ON Platinum Hydro Whey added that vanilla flavor back to the P90 mix; and also beefed up the protein to carb ratio. (The P90 has a lot more carbs than proteins.) To this I added a bit of real Tang.As other people have reported, the Hydro Whey mixes very easily and thoroughly (even moreso than the P90 mix, by the way, which is no slouch in this department!) On the other hand, I probably wouldn't try to drink this as a straight milk supplement or alone with water, as I doubt the taste, although very good, would be strong enough for me. On yet another hand, the taste has no mineralish bite or aftertaste to it (because there aren't any added vitamins and minerals, duh!)Buyers should keep in mind the report of other reviewers, that ON is being rather misleading about the supposedly superior amount of protein compared to their normal Gold Standard whey products. Mathematically speaking, there is practically no difference. I can't testify to any other differences, although technically I suppose the hydrolyzed state should metabolize much faster (and maybe mixes better). On the other hand, some people don't actually want so quick a metabolization, and would rather have the material digest over time. I don't know enough to opine on the merits of either theory, but as someone who has trouble digesting milk products I appreciate any quicker digestion!Anyway, I'm buying it again and getting rid of the other things I test-bought, as they don't mix as well or taste as good (although the latter is subjective and they do have advantages this doesn't. But of course I'm mixing this with something that has those other advantages already, so...)

I purchased this product a few months ago and thought that the flavor was delicious. I just got a new canister and the taste is really bad. To me, it has a chemical taste to it, and I find it to be inedible. Maybe just a bad batch, I don’t know. I was able to get a refund, so I really appreciate that. I gave it three stars because the first time I got it I loved it, but this time I couldn’t drink it.

This stuff is good, and it works.  The protein is filtered several times.  Hydrolyzed Whey is more easily absorbed into the body for fast max results.  Buy it.  Chocolate only though if you can.  Amazon just recently ran out of Chocolate, so I bought Vanilla - not very good.

See Update on Bottom :---I have had problems with other whey powders making me feel sick,  I did want a protein powder  that would metabolize fast for better recovery after weight lifting. I gave this a try hoping it would not make me feel sick like other whey powders have.  This does not bother my stomach at all I feel good after drinking it. YAHOO!!Taste is a problem, I bought chocolate and it is way too sweet, I definitely did not enjoy drinking this. I think mixing it with a bitter agent might help and since I work out in the morning i will use black coffee as the liquid base rather than just water.  I am hoping this will make the taste more pleasant. I would have given this 5 stars if the taste was better, Texture was fine and it mixed easily.I am not lactose intolerant, so I am not sure why other whey powders have bothered me but I am glad this one does notUpdate -- This product has helped me recover from hard weight lifting workouts so i can be ready to workout again. I am 57 and am pushing myself to failure three days a week on my workouts. I had been struggling and onny able to get two hard workouts done but with this and the Creatine powder from the same brand I am back to three full body workout a week.Taste had been a problem and after experimenting with several ways to make this I found a ""whey,"" put intended, to make this taste very good.  Silk makes a Almond Cashew Protein Milk that includes pea protein in two option, original with 3 grams of carbs and a newer sweeter one with 10 grams of carbs. I am mixing 14 ounces of the lower carb version with a level scoop of Hydrowhey and add two Ice cubes to make it colder in an insulated metal shaker bottle.The result is a very good tasting Chocolate milk shake. The final product ends up with 47 Grams of protein and  368 Calories with only 7 Grams of Carbs. If this fits in your dietary goals it is a great and delicious protein shake.  All with no nausea!!! whoo hoo!

I’ve been using this protein for about a year now, and I gotta say it’s the best out there i’ve had. The gains using this are insane, you feel more energized and it tastes great. The price is the biggest concern, but it’s hydro protein so the benefits and quality far outweigh the price. Others saying that it’s too sweet are exaggerating in my opinion, it tastes like a milkshake, but if it’s too sweet then cut it with more milk/water, duh. Highly recommend this product, and won’t be getting anything else ever again.

Optimum Nutrition is not new to the scene and they certainly produce great-value products, like their Gold Standard protein 
Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate, 5 Pound
 and multivitamins 
Optimum Nutrition Opti-Men Multivitamins, 180-Count
However, Hydro Whey is expensive and a lesser value, but why is it worth it?First off, for all the hard gainers like myself out there, the increased content of BCAA's is important for protein anabolism.  You can only create as much as the weakest link and without a single amino acid or fuel to create the essential ones, you are falling short.Secondly, this stuff mixes like a champ! We've all been there with the proteins that fail to mix well, leaving clumps to swallow and dry powder to lick out of our cups and shaker bottles.  I highly recommend a shaker bottle 
Blender Bottle W/Wire Ball-Large 28 Oz. Colors Vary
 for all mixing purposes, for its convenience as well as efficiency.  However, this is the ONLY protein I've ever been able to mix in a cup when a mixer/blender was not available and there are no clumps at all.  It does produce a more frothy, lighter shake than does Gold Standard or even Platinum Hydrobuilder, making it easier to consume and break down.  The taste is much smoother than its thicker Gold Standard counterpart. It will curb your appetite slightly (characteristic of all proteins), but not as bad as other protein shakes do which can be important when you need to consume that post-workout meal.Now, as to whether ""hydrolyzed"" whey is better than the regular stuff, that's for you to decide.  It has worked for me, and I'm not going back to Gold Standard anytime soon for all the reasons above, but remember scientific 'philosophies' or lab work does not all translate to the same benefits in real-life applications like the human body (where everyone reacts differently).  Hydro-Whey has been a winner for me, and I've tried many, many proteins before: Muscletech, BSN, Optimum, etc.Please do your research as different proteins have different applications and this stuff is reserved for primarily upon waking and immediately post-workout.  If you're looking for meal replacement or anabolic longevity, look elsewhere.  Hydro-whey provides instant fuel when your body needs it most, and to maximize muscle gains, I'm willing to pay a premium after working hard in the gym day in, day out.

I have been taking protein powders for almost 20 years I have literally tried hundreds of flavors, types of protein and manufacturers. From egg to whey to crickets (not kidding) and soy.This is without a doubt one of the best tasting, highest quality proteins I have ever used.My son (5) is a notoriously picky eater and always needs more protein in his diet. He's one of those kids that would rather go hungry than eat something he doesn't want.On a whim, I tried giving him this and he LOVES it! So, this has become a go to for me and my son.My only minor complaint is that while it mixes in water well, it needs significant agitating to blend smoothly. I suggest a shaker bottle.There are a lot of manufacturers with questionable quality or who do not use clinically tested doses of products. Optimum Nutrition is a brand that conforms to GMP standards. You get what you pay for - this one is well worth it!!

Short review: This products works well, tastes great, and is easy on the stomach.  I would recommend it.Longer review:I'll start off by briefly informing you that I use this product specifically to supplement my protein intake after a workout.  Previously, I used Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard Whey for the past ~2 years.  Before that, I've used a few others and concluded that ON seems to deliver the best overall protein.  That being said, I tried ON's Hydrowhey because hydrolyzed whey is absorbed very quickly after consumption.Taste (Turbo Chocolate): 9/10Vanilla soymilk is my preferred base liquid, and this flavor tastes great with it.  ...Probably even better than their Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate flavor.Mixability: 8/10I've used the same blender bottle for about two years as well, and this Hydrowhey seemed to clump up slightly more than their Gold Standard and stick to the lid of the bottle.  Not a huge deal, but worth noting.Ingredients: 9.5/10Lots of protein and not a whole lot of other garbage that a lot of commercial proteins contain.  People will complain about artificial ingredients in their protein, but I'm not from that camp.  Personally, I'd be upset if they started dumping sugar into it.  It's also noteworthy that this protein powder (like other ON protein powders) has BCAAs, which is convenient, so that I don't have to order another product or even risk forgetting to take it.Digestability: 8/10I include this because there's a common talking point about hydro whey being tough on your stomach.  For this reason, I procrastinated in trying this, but I'm glad that I did.  Personally, this maybe had an effect on my stomach about 5% of the time (maybe 2 or 3 days out of the first month that I used it).All in all, I'd recommend ON's hydrowhey.  I only tried their Turbo Chocolate flavor, and it's definitely a winner.  It's a little pricey, but the quality of ingredients and taste make it worth it.  I paid full price for my whey and my opinions are my own.  If you found this review to be helpful in any way, feel free to tap the ""Yes"" button to indicate this was helpful to you.  Thanks!

Normally I sit on the sideline and just read reviews but it bothers me when people give misinformed reviews possibly swaying people away from a perfectly good product. First of all this isn't your run of the mill protein powder. This product contains hydrolyzed whey protein which your body metabolizes much better than other forms of whey, especially whey concentrate (check the labels of most protein powders and see what the first protein listed is, it's probably concentrate). Concentrate is easy to produce and is one of the least efficient forms of whey. It's not that it doesn't work but an awful lot of it get converted into waste. Also, since hydrolyzed whey is metabolized better an added benefit is that it is easier on your stomach (protein shakes don't always agree with everyone).The reason hydrolyzed whey is more expensive is because the refining process is much more involved and the yield is much less at the end of the process. The biggest negative to hydrolyzed whey is the taste. Hydrolyzed proteins typically are very bitter. The ON Platinum Whey tastes phenomenal for a hydrolyzed whey product. If all you want is a great tasting milk shake and don't care about the quality of protein then look elsewhere.This brings me to my biggest gripe with a lot of reviewers. Please stop comparing apples and oranges. Yes it is more expensive than ON Gold Whey but for the reasons I mentioned above there are additional costs in manufacturing and as a result there are added benefits to the consumer. 1 gram of whey concentrate is not equal to 1 gram of hydrolyzed whey. So stop comparing it to the Whey gold gram for gram. It's not just marketing hype, they market it as platinum because it is a better product.I've been using this product for over a year and I've tried a plethora of other brands but this by far is the best tasting hydrolyzed whey formula in my experience. There might be more pure hydrolyzed whey out there but the bitterness is nauseating.This is a great product by a reputable company. It isn't magic and it's not perfect, nothing is. Hydrolyzed whey isn't for everyone either. I agree with other reviewers, do your research. Just make sure you are comparing apples to apples, the nutrition info doesn't tell the whole story. Read the ingredients.

One of the most important features of proteins is the way and ease of eating them. Some proteins, which are generally non-isolated, cannot be consumed more than two scoops during the day, but this protein is very light and you can even take up to 6 scoops a day.  consumption which is very important for recovery

I've used whey protein isolate supplements for over 20 years, including all the Major Brands, NB isopure, optimum nutrition, dymatize.  NB isopure was my go to supplement for many years, but got a couple of batches that tasted off.  Tried optimum nutrition and dymatize, both were ok.  I do not seem to have any problem digesting whey isolate, but thought I would see if there was a difference with a hydrolyzed version.  I cannot tell the difference, this tasted OK, but clumped to a little bit which is disappointing, and required a lot of stirring in to get it fully mixed.  If you have trouble digesting whey isolate, you might give this a try to see if the hydrolyzed process helps you.  Otherwise, it is not worth the premium price.  ps the vanilla version mixes very well, but again not worth the premium price unless it digests more easily for you

I’ve gone through multiple different brands and types of whey protein powder over 6-7 years and nothing holds a candle to this. The flavor is unremarkable and inoffensive. The macros are great compared to some other carb-heavy protein powders out there. But most importantly this powder has given me exactly zero side effects compared to others. While I am not lactose intolerant, I experience bloating and get acne breakouts when having 2+ scoops a day of most whey protein powders, but this one came without any of those issues. The only issue is how expensive it is but I’m more than willing to pay the premium and I don’t see myself ever buying a different type or brand of whey in the future.

General:Extremely high quality protein. The price is absolutely justified. Know that most other protein powders out there are not made equal. They're mostly below this one in quality. A full scoop mixes very well with 6-8 ounces of water in my shaker bottle. Also mixes well with milk, not as good as water, but definitely still good. Try it in a blender for smoothest results!Flavors (that I have tried):Turbo Chocolate (TC) - great all around. Tastes just fine. To me, it's not something that tastes so good that I couldn't wait to drink it, but it does not taste bad to any extent. It's kind of like water to me, I need it, I drink it, and done. Awesome. I give it an 8.5/10 on taste. Next, it mixes so well, sometimes the consistency of the shake was barely distinguishable from water. It's also very versatile! If you plan on adding multiple ingredients to your shake, chances are that TC will pair well. If you're trying the product out for the first time, get this one.Cookies and Cream Overdrive (CCO) - Ugh. No, just no. Don't get it. Protein quality is obviously the same, but just....no. It's especially bad as the first thing in the morning. I give it a 4.5/10. After having TC flavor, I decided to be a bit more adventurous. Got this one in the hopes that it would taste similar to Muscle Milk's cookies and cream flavor and boy did it tank. Optimum Nutrition dropped the ball on CCO. Not only does it not taste good, but it doesn't mix as well as TC does. Multiple times I've had some of the unmixed but wet powder lining the bottom edges of my shaker bottle. Had to dig it out with a spoon. Blasted waste. After my first serving, I dreaded that I had to wait at least a month to finish the stuff and go back to something better. I eventually got used to the taste, but please don't subject yourself to that kind of torture.Think I may just stick to Turbo Chocolate!

I ordered the double rich chocolate (DBC), thanks to reviews indicating it did not use sucralose (and it does not as of 06/12/18).I've never used ON before, I do not know if it ""used to"" taste better. As of 06/12/18 the DBC flavor tastes roughly like burnt brownie flavored cardboard. Thing is, I understand without a SUPER sweetener, it can be difficult to achieve flavor, but be forewarned, it is AWFUL tasting. Consistency remains almost the same as whatever liquid you have mixed it into (adds no extra thickness). I tried both water and milk.On the positive front, it is jam packed with goodies with every scoop. It mixes extremely well (I use milk mainly) and when mixed with other powders, it continued to mix well (I add extra probiotics and stuff for my joints).I let it sit for a few hours on the counter, everything settled and needed a slight jostle, but (aside from being warm) mixed right back up and tasted exactly the same with the same consistency, which is great as I have had powders that turn to sludge if you let it sit for too long.

I've been using the Whey Gold product for many years. A little under 1 scoop 2x/day helps me keep my hard earned muscle mass. This Platinum appears to be marketed as higher quality/more effective protein, so I thought I'd try it out, even though the smaller 3.5 lb tub immediately made me suspicious of its value.First of all, the chocolate that I bought tastes fantastic and mixes great. But in comparison to the Whey Gold product, I feel the Platinum is a marketing gimmick and a product that mostly just increases profits for this company without really adding value to the consumer. Why is that?The most obvious trick that I didn't catch when comparing the two before buying: Scoop size/protein in grams. Andy Rooney always complains about this type of thing, so I guess he is my mentor in this case...Whey Gold: 1 scoop = 24 grams protein.Platinum: 1 scoop = 30 grams protein.So you figure you are getting more protein for your buck, right? More protein per scoop? Wrong. The Platinum scoop is bigger! What I missed was the serving size:Whey Gold: Serving size 30gPlatinum: Serving size 39gSure enough. The scoop they give you with the Platinum is bigger than the Whey Gold. Compare the two. I did once I got the Platinum shipment.So is the protein in the Platinum any more concentrated than the Whey Gold? It doesn't appear to be, at least in grams per comparable serving.The other differences...I see they put some ""creamer"" in the Platinum which is not in the Whey Gold. I also think the Platinum might be a little sweeter. My point here is that these 2 features improve the taste/texture of the Platinum vs. the Whey Gold and make you think the Platinum is better. I actually like these changes and wish they'd incorporate them into the Whey Gold - but don't be fooled into thinking the Platinum is somehow more effective because of this (unless taste is more important to you than getting high quality protein at the best price).Yeah, I could be missing something else here. Like maybe the Platinum quality - gram for gram - is technically a little better. But I'm not going to worry about that since I'll never be able to figure it out. I really don't think trying one for a while and then the other is going to prove that - they probably aren't THAT much different. Someone else can do the math, but I bet you could use close to twice as much Whey Gold as Platinum for the same price per gram of protein. So use a little less than twice as much, and you'll be saving money and getting more protein.If money is no object, the Platinum could be the superior product. MAYBE you can take less or the same amount and get better results. It definitely tastes good. But I'll just stick with the Whey Gold which I know works and I'm SURE is the better value.

Just a quick flavor review. I'm coming over from Muscle Milk. I usually drink Natural Vanilla or Cookies & Cream with Muscle Milk. I just tried the Velocity Vanilla from Optimum Nutrition Hydrowhey and it's not very good at all. I actually enjoy the Muslce Milk flavor but this is pretty bad tasting.On the plus side, It's only 1 scoop so i'll live with it. I may try chocolate next time.Muscle Milk: 2 scoops, 280 Cal, 32g ProtienOptimum Nutrition Hydrowhey: 1 scoop, 140 calories, 30g Protien

Ive been taking this protein for probably 3 to 4 years and it is my absolute favorite protein. I'm lactose intolerant so less calcium the better. The flavor is great. It says 6 to 8 ounces of water but I tend to do 12 ounces and it still tastes fine. Unfortunately it is getting harder to find and becoming more expensive. 30g of protein is pretty spot on. Not too little not to much.

I’ve been very happy with this powder and I’ve tried a lot over the years. I always use reduced fat milk when preparing this product so I don’t know how well it works with water.Flavor: has a malt-like chocolate flavor that seems like it’s going to have a nasty aftertaste but thankfully doesn’t. It doesn’t have that delicious MuscleMilk level of flavor but it’s also a lot more healthy. Overall it’s a good, easy-to-drink chocolate flavor that isn’t very sweet.Texture: mixes easily but a spoon will leave a few sticky clumps floating around. To be honest it mixes well enough that I’m willing to deal with the minor clumping to avoid having to clean a blender or shaker bottle. Not too thick which is a good thing.Performance: obviously an opinion, but I feel a bit less sore the next day than I otherwise would’ve been had I not drank this after my workout. It works.Price: it’s more expensive than normal whey powder but the increased cost is expected with hydrolyzed whey as it’s a premium product. There are more and less expensive products on the market but I think you will have to spend significantly more to get a marginally better quality product so it’s priced just right IMO. Besides this isn’t intended to be your all-purpose whey powder anyway.I will be purchasing another container when mine runs out.

I love working out, so I use whey protein and I love to experiment with different kinds. I mainly stuck with Now Foods - Whey Protein Isolate, because it has no preservatives or additives or any chemical crap in it and you can feel and see the difference in it. Well after killing 40 pounds of Now Foods, I wanted to try something new and didn't want chocolate or vanilla. I went with the strawberry Hydro Whey by ON. I'm not a big fan of ON because they use Maltodextrin and artificials that cause health problems and weight gain in the gut.I have to say, for a protein that has artificials in it, this is pretty good. I love the taste, it mixes very very easy with a blender ball cup and the taste of the strawberry literally tasted like strawberry. It is really sweet, so if you like sweet things, this is easy to down within seconds. I normally chug it because it tastes that great.To say for performance wise, after I drink this, I feel good but I sometimes feel that crash or lazy feeling you get from the additive crap in it.If ON would take out their artificial ingredient and just let it be, I would stick with it. but I have to say, this is a great protein overall if you don't believe in the artificial ingredients affecting your body. I for one can tell a difference from the Now Foods to this one.Overall, I would recommend this because it is one of the best Caseins out there for performance and taste.

I am extremely lactose intolerant and have been looking for a protein shake that does not make me sick for a long time. After purchasing this shake, I can gladly say I've found it!Being extremely lactose intolerant, I often tend to get sick from things that taste like milk, even though the lactose content is minimal. This shake has a strong milk taste, which is the only negative thing about it. But, I decided not to mark it down as all protein shakes have a strong milk taste, and because you can easily go around the milk taste by mixing it with Gatorade powder or crystal light on the go packs (sugar-free). Without mixing it with something else, however, I can't drink it. If you do not like a milk taste, then I'd recommend you get the Strawberry flavor as you can easily mix it with out flavors... not so much with the Chocolate or Vanilla flavor.The best thing about this shake is that it really doesn't contain any lactose (other's say they contain zero grams, but still contain milligrams), and it does not upset my stomach. I sometimes feel a bit bloated, but it doesn't last very long as the hydro whey is quickly digested.As far as the results go, I am already starting to see result after just a few days. As far as the preparing goes, you really don't need to blend it, you can simply stir your shake and it'll be fine as well.My ratings:Taste: 2/5 (This is obviously subjective, others who love milkshakes will love it)Mixing: 5/5 (Stirring or blending works fine)Digestion: 5/5 (Quickly digested, perfect for people with lactose intolerance)Results: 5/5 (You'll notice results after a few days)Price: 4/5 (It's a bit more expensive than other shakes, but it's definitely worth the money)

I purchased this a few months ago after doing a ton of research on many different protein powders. I've tried a few different brands, both in powders and premixed shakes. I had gastric sleeve surgery almost a year ago so protein is a very important aspect of my diet. My biggest problem is flavor! I can't stand a lot of the products I've tried, it's either gritty or tastes awful, or usually, it's both. That being said, this powder is acceptable to me. It's not absolutely gag worthy but it's definitely not delicious either. It almost has an oat taste to it, which is odd but not really gross or tasty either. The protein in it is good quality and I can tell because it doesn't cause gas or bloating. My favorite is still Premier Protein shakes in chocolate but this one is good for after my workouts or if I'm really low on protein for the day. I mix it with fairlife milk, in a cup with a whisk and it blends fairly well. Please don't buy into the myth that your body can only absorb so much protein at once either because it simply isn't true. I'll still continue to look for a shake that tastes good without a ton of carbs but at this point at least I've found something tolerable. That in and of itself has been a challenge! I would definitely recommend this product tho, especially if you're like me and have extremely picky taste buds.

The macros are good, but between the price over ON's Gold Standard Whey and how watered down it tastes, no one in the household liked this protein powder. It's not the worst by any means, but I could see it more as an ingredient in high-protein meals (ie overnight oats) rather than a powder I'd mix into a drink.

So far so good. Still in my first batch ordered my second already. Been a long time consumer of the ON Gold one and decided to give this one a try. I am going to give you my honest feedback. The taste ? It’s actually better than Gold and it’s better mixed with water rather than milk. Coz it gets coagulated for some reason with milk and I know a lot of folks said the mixability is great and that Holds good only if you mix it with water so avoid milk and it tastes great. It does feel kinda full after I have the shake unlike with the Gold one. But you know what’s the best positive I do feel a difference in recovery time after heavy and intensive workouts. I think I have less body strains and my body feels refreshed the next day and I remember the ON Gold one never gave me such an instant impact. I would rate it as the best ever protein I have had till date but the 4 stars is only coz it’s not actually great mixing with any kind of milk ( tried peas , soy and Zero fat organic milk ) and not exactly fart free. Hahaha but I don’t care coz I feel the results and get the desired impact from what I need for my body!

There are a LOT of protein products out there, and it can be really difficult to weigh the pros/cons between all of them.  I've tried just about all of them.  It doesn't help that some of those products will try and trick people by making their serving size 2 or even 3 scoops.  What I look for in a good protein powder is something provides a very high-percentage of protein with no extra fluff that might interfere with my normal diet and vitamin supplements.  And, no digestive side-effects are a huge plus, of course.Pros:- High protein content per serving (30g per scoop; each scoop is 39g, so you're looking at 77% protein by mass)- Very low sugar and carbs (only 1g and 3g per serving, respectively)- Low on vitamins, which allows me to take vitamin supplements without worrying about getting too much calcium, for example- No digestive side-effects; I can consume 120g of this per day and not experience the usual bloat you get from other protein powders- Tastes great mixed with just milkCons:- Price is moderately high, but it's not the most expensive out thereMy routine is to mix this with flax milk in a Blender bottle.  Since flax milk has no lactose and typically no sugar, I get a very clean protein beverage out of it.

Those who say it needs a better flavor should go try the ones with ungodly amounts of sugar. If you’re buying protein powder for the flavor then you can get another brand and slurp down a cookies and cream milkshake. I take this with water and a little bit of vanilla almond milk and it’s perfect. Not too thick where I feel like I’m drinking melted ice cream but still has enough flavor to go down easy. This is the 5th protein powder I’ve tried and it’s the best. Absorbs really well in a blender bottle, whereas other brands will leave you chewing on chunks. Never had that once with powder and I’ve been using for about a month now.

Okay. I normally do not like these powders as they either clump up or have a weird after taste. I've been using this at work in the mornings to help keep me full. I read all the reviews here, and applied all I saw about using a little less water if you want a stronger taste or more water for a weaker taste, also after shaking it up, put it in the fridge for 30 minutes to get rid of clumps and chunks. I found this is what works best for me:10oz of water1 Scoop (the one provided)Shake up for 30 secondsput in 1 Serving of PB2 (good stuff)Shake up for 20 secondsPut in Fridge for 30 minutesDrinkSo far this method has worked flawlessly, I have no seen one clump of the powder or the PB2 and all I am using is a simple little 12 oz shaker for mixing it and drinking it.The taste is really good with or with out the PB2 taste, it kind of tastes like a chocolate drink and if you use less water you get that rich chocolate taste, it almost feels like I am cheating :DHighly suggest you try the smaller bottle before investing in the large one.

I have finally found my perfect whey powder.  I've tried numerous whey powders and always had some type of issue with digestibility.  Even whey isolates sometimes gave me problems.  I decided to give this a shot after having issues with ON Performance Whey Isolate.  It caused bloating and stomach upset at times.  Once I tried this hydro whey, I knew I found a keeper.  The taste is the best I've tasted yet.  To me it tastes like Nestle Quick when mixed with skim milk.  Even when mixed with water it still tastes good, just a tiny bit more diluted.  With a full 30 grams of protein per 39 gram scoop, you get quality protein and nearly 9 grams of BCAAs without a lot of ""proprietary blend"" mystery filler.  I won't sit here and say this is the best source of protein ever, because it isn't.  I still get the bulk of my protein from the absolute best source that blows any protein powder out of the water: food.  However, if you're looking for a great tasting protein supplement powder that absorbs fast, tastes great and is easy on the stomach, this is it.  I only wish I got a little more for the price, but I plan to keep using.

I've been supplementing with whey protein for a few years now and have tried just about everything. I used to just buy cheaper products but must have developed an allergy and now get shortness of breath anytime I use anything that isn't ultra pure. I assume that it is a milk allergy. I tried plant based proteins (disgusting) and pretty much every other protein (still gave me shortness of breath). I've been using this platinum hydro whey for about one year now and haven't had any problems. If anyone else has allergies and is still trying to supplement with protein I also recommend BCAAs. I haven't had a problem with the unflavored Optimum Nutrition BCAAs I use either. As for the taste of this stuff, IMO, the chocolate flavor is EXTREMELY good! I sometimes add some steviosides or even raw cocoa powder to this stuff and I think it tastes like hot cocoa! haha. I haven't tasted a better chocolate flavored protein powder, especially one without added carbs. I did decide to branch out and try the cookies and cream on one occasion but that was a mistake.... I was not a fan and didn't even end up finishing it. I've never really liked any protein flavors other than chocolate though.

This is a good tasting whey isolate protein.  I generally put it in a blender with a handful of frozen cherries and a cup of unsweet coconut milk, but it works well in a shaker too.I'm switching back to the ON Gold Standard, though.  This is strictly a cost-based move; I use two scoops per shake and the Gold gives a little more product for slightly less $$$.

First I'll say only time will tell on any kind of results I get from this. But initial reactions are very positive. The most important thing for me is the taste. I have tried many protein powders over time and I always get chocolate because it's usually the most palatable. This is by far the absolute best I've ever tried. It smells and tastes just like hot chocolate. It's not gritty or weird and after mixing is very smooth. I've used water and milk and either way it still tastes great. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to try something new or that's looking to start supplementing to begin with.

Hydrolyzed whey protein is partially digested and it tastes awful, that's just how it is. If you buy a hydrolyzed whey protein that doesn't taste terrible, it's because it contains very little hydrolyzed whey.Hydrolyzed whey has a powerful muscle building effect because of its bioavailability and because it's insulinotropic and will create lean muscle much better than any other protein source. (hydrolyzed collagen or collagen peptides also has similar benefits)Optimum Nutrition Hydrolyzed Whey tastes like it should, but not as good as other protein powders made from lesser protein. Hope they keep making it, but reviewers seem to be put off by the flavor. Mix it with another protein powder and some milk to take the edge off the flavor.

I really like the flavor of the Vanilla platinum hydrowhey.  I also like how easily it mixes.  And all the reading I've done leads me to believe it's higher quality.  I've been lifting a lot, drinking it, and getting stronger - question of how much is due to the whey?  Probably some!If you can afford it, I recommend it.  I am not sure how much additional value it delivers beyond the regular gold standard, but I'll keep using it in case.  I have been getting stronger!

I have been using GNC's brand for the longest time but gave this a try after the stores near me started closing. I tried it this morning for the first time and was surprised by how easily it mixes (so many years wasted on chunky protein shakes). The taste is just okay but I'm not a huge chocolate guy and it's not like I drink this for the taste. The fact that it's easier to mix and go down quickly (plus a good amount of protein) makes it a winner for me.  (I just wish this was available without the artificial flavoring, colors, and sweeteners.)

I’ve been buying this protein for years. I didn’t mind the price going up because it consistently had good taste and was great either with a blender or stir mixed. It goes great in coffee if your coffee isn’t too hot. Now, you must exclusively use it with a blender because it doesn’t mix with a spoon. That sounds stupid, but it’s inconvenient and feels like a drop in quality. So if you use a blender only, it’s for you, but there are probably cheaper options out there. It’s sucks to see their quality have yanked so much over the years.

This protein powder is the best powder I've used as far as settling well on my stomach (very lactose intolerant). Coupled with Silk Almond Milk, it doesn't taste that bad (VANILLA FLAVOR). To be honest, it's the smell and after taste that are foul. I would definitely recommend holding your nose while drinking and having some gum for after you drink it, but otherwise it's great. It may not be as much of a problem for others, but it is better after it has been chilled. I mix it and put it in the fridge before I workout, and by the time I get home it's chilled and the smell wears off a bit.Other than the luxuries, the protein powder does just what it should. I have a high protein/calorie diet so I can't really comment on if this specifically made me gain any weight, but it has helped in DOMS reduction and recovery time.I'll probably try this in another flavor whenever I finish this batch.Texture: 8/10Smell: 3/10Taste: 8/10Aftertaste: 5/10Easy on the stomach? 10/10Works?: 10/10If you have any questions feel free to comment and I will do my best to reply as soon as possible.

I've been mixing liquid vitamins with protein powder for years. I keep looking for the most potent, high protein whey product, and over the years I've tried many. This product is very good and the vendor sends it quickly. I tried to ration what I had in order to make it to the delivery date.  Luckily it came three days sooner.  Did I mention I was in the Olympic trials for the marathon, and haven't eaten meat since 1980.  And yes, I still run three miles every other day and workout daily. I feel great at 73 and attribute it to this product, or earlier whey versions and a healthy lifestyle.

Great tasting, easy mixing protein powder. I'm lactose intolerant and it gives me no trouble, blends easily in water, lactaid milk, or plant milk with or without a blender bottle. Tastes so good with milk you could fool someone into thinking it's a real shake. Not the cleanest ingredients (artificial sweeteners, but most have this) and it is pricy but I would say it's totally worth the price.

Whey protein is way overpriced, a rip off no matter what brand you buy, if you are buying decent protein. I've done a lot of research on the web and tried a number of different sites over the years. Some of them used to have sale prices combined with free shipping that made them better values, but these days it seems no matter where I look A'n has the best of a bunch of overly high prices.I've used Optimum Nutrition for years because I both work out and donate blood plasma, which means I'm constantly struggling to keep my protein levels up. The bottom line is that when I do not use this product my protein levels are too low to donate and when I do use it consistently they generally remain high enough to donate, which tells you something about the product since blood plasma is comprised mostly of water and protein.Flavor-wise, double milk chocolate is the one I have tried which has not made me nauseous after having used 2 or 3 pounds of the container. It is not exactly delicious but it is tolerable as long as you don't water it down too much.

I've tried everything from ON, MyProtein, Ghost, pretty much everything out there. I always come back to this flavor when it's on sale. The scoop is the smallest out of all the protein powders I've tried, which is good because it makes the drink less thick overall. The flavor really is the best and does not taste like a supplement at all. I'd say it tastes like chocolate Nesquik when mixed with either milk or water. If you're reading this, chances are you've seen the many reviews with this flavor consistently at the top. Believe it, it's the real deal and historically my number 1 flavored protein for years.

I've been a fan of ""ON Gold Standard Whey"" for a longtime. The Protein taste great compared to others I've used, mixes well, and is well priced for the quality of the protein you get. I try other proteins from time to time but end up coming back to ""ON Whey"" Protein.

Best deal anywhere when the 10lb bags drop below 110-105.. sometimes down below 90. Best tasting / easiest mixing / quality ingredients. #1 go to for protein. I have been bodybuilding for 10 years and this is by far the best bang for your buck.

This is a 5-star protein, and Optimum is the only brand of protein supplement I'll buy.  I usually buy from Bodybuilding.com and was very surprised to see I could get some supplements on Amazon for cheaper (by a couple dollars).The reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because the zipper part of the zip lock on top of the bag was missing.  This is kind of an important part of the product considering its 10 lbs of protein and I can't easily find another container for it.  It is possible to get the bag to re-zip, but more difficult to get it unzipped again.Blah...I hate inconveniences

This product is Good.  I rated it 3-stars because the chocolate taste is a little weak which may bother some people.  That said, for me, this works great.  It allows me to add a full second scoop and increase my protein intake without increasing the amount of milk I'm consuming.  By the way, I find that mixed with Whole Milk, that comes from grass fed cows, the richness of the milk coupled with the thickening effect of the protein makes the mixture taste and drink like a thin chocolate milk shake.

I Like this stuff.  I only buy the vanilla flavor so I cannot comment on the others - I like the taste - like a slightly sweeter Muscle Milk without the chalky aftertaste.  Some friends find the taste of Stevia too sweet and a bit metallic, but I don't notice it.  Ah, but you MUST drink it cold.  I mix 3 scoops with a few ice cubes and 40 ounces of water in an insulated water bottle and shake it up manually - it mixes well.  Not as filling as some of the plant based powders but that's not what I'm looking for.  I have heard it foams up something crazy in a blender but I never blend it.

Product is good but has the strange taste that stevia has. I'm mixing it with other sweetend and unsweetened powder to use it up. Mixed in coffee its not bad but by itself is a bit strange for my taste. If your mixing it into a shake or something else its a great healthier product vs the artificially sweetend ones.

This is by far the best protein powder ive taken and ive tried pretty much all proteins out there. When I say all I meant all the good one and the ones that claim to be clean ingredients. I don't try the one that are heavily promoted and gimmicky. Whenever I see guy on instagram telling me to use his promo, I block him. So I do my research and ive come to this as being the best so far. there may be better ones but to my comparison, this beats all ive tried. Clean inngredits, no additives, don't feel bloated and heavy. It's fast absorbing which I like as a post workout. and the flavor is not overwhelming.

Ascent doesn’t even come close to any of the mentioned protein powders.  But keep in mind the Axe and Sledge is $70, Steel is around $55, and Nutrithority is $50.  Ascent is good protein for the price but for me once I tasted the protein wasn’t very tasty.  I will spend the extra money and not purchase Ascent protein again.

This protein is truly the best tasting, and cleanest protein that I've tried. I've actually been using it for a few years with good results. I just started buying it from Amazon due to the better pricing and convenience of shipping. I think this protein doesn't cause as much acne as other whey proteins do, and I like that not a lot of extra stuff is added, unlike other proteins.PRO TIP: I get the chocolate flavor and mix it with peanut butter powder (Giving it some extra protein, BTW) and it tastes amazing, even with just water in my shaker bottle!

Worth the money. I first picked this up at a local supermarket and I never went back. Great taste with quality ingredients, without the added extra fat and calories that a lot of other protein powders have.

Ever hear the joke about La Croix? That it tastes like someone shouting the name of a fruit from another room? The Lemon Sorbet reminded me of that wisecrack - the flavor is very subtle. I was expecting more lemon flavor, I guess. And the bag won't stay zipped... I really struggle with getting it to stay closed after I've had some. But maybe I got a ""bad"" bag. These probably aren't deal breakers for a lot of folks, but it's enough to keep me searching for a more suitable protein powder.

My husband and I both love Ascent protein.  Love that it's clean and provides 25 grams of protein per serving.  The price is great for the quality of product - comparable products are at least $10-30 more.  We were fans of the chocolate flavor and took a chance on the Mocha Cold Brew (some special flavors just fall short) and we were NOT disappointed.  We've both recommended it (esp MCB flavor) to everyone via our social media stories.  You can't go wrong with Ascent!  We will continue to order this product and try new flavors.

I have tried a lot of protein powders. I don’t want overly sweets, or added sugars. My body reacts weird to suraclose and stevia and such. The vanilla is the only one that has strictly monk fruit for a sweetener and it doesn’t affect me. It’s a great flavor and can be added to anything (protein balls, pancakes, smoothies and even coffee).

Product is as described.  Now this is only my opinion, but taste could be a little bit less chalky and the powder settles to the bottom of the glass/shaker if left over night in the fridge for the morning boost.  (I use the magic bullet to mix my protein shake with banana and peanut butter)  overall no complaints and does the job.

This product, in terms of quality, is top tier. Just look at the ingredients. There’s no amino spiking, no garbage. Just pure quality protein. Which I’m sure some of you don’t know about spiking, but most of your protein powders that say 25g or more are actually lying and you’re probably only getting 14g-17g of quality muscle building protein. Yes, it’s a little pricey, but understandably so. Regarding taste, it’s good. I’ve only had chocolate, but have found nothing offensive about it. Now it doesn’t have that super creamy backbone that some look for, but that’s probably a result of other poor ingredients to give you that mouth feel. I don’t find it to be overly sweet like some of the comments mention. In fact other products like Syntha 6 and such I find to be much sweeter than this one.To the people who said be aware of allergy concerns “it contains MILK!” Just shut up. Like honestly stop speaking. Where do you think whey comes from? You got bigger problems and need to do more education and research before you start taking supplements if you can’t make that connection.

I often don't like powders with sugar substitutes because they taste ""diet"" to me. Also, it's annoying how many vanilla powders are over the top artificial vanilla smelling and tasting. And there'll be either such low natural sugar that it's not sweet, or so much sugar substitute that it's overkill sweet but that ""not real sugar"" type of sweet.I just made my first smoothie with this and it was delightful. I usually use unsweetened almond or coconut milk and add fruit and greens. The texture, smell, and overall taste was great! Subtle sweet, natural vanilla flavor, blended well with the other ingredients to make a refreshing, delicious smoothie. I think I've found my new every day protein powder. Yay!

This protein isn’t going to amaze you with the flavor profile. It’s definitely something that could be better implemented in a smoothie. That said, I’ve gone through half the bag with cold water or almond milk in a shaker bottle—no problem. The other flavors appear to use stevia, which is sometimes too sweet, so this is definitely the high bar for a minimally sweet, non-artificially flavored protein. Will purchase again from Ascent … possibly strawberry again.

I feel like I have tried a lot of whey in my life. Whey has evolved a lot. It's not all created equal. IMO ingredients matter. Taste and consistency matter. I hate spending money on whey that no one in my house will use. I originally found this brand at WF on sale. I like chocolate PB flavored anything. It mixes pretty well with water. I mix this with coffee a lot. I do not mind the taste. I recommended this brand to people when they're looking for a cleaner whey. I was excited to find this on a lightning deal since the retail price is on the moderate to high side. I am a repeat purchaser of this product

I'm impressed with the ingredients, both the types and quantities. Just a handful of ingredients vs. 20+ with other proteins. The product smells like cocoa, a very faint cocoa, but it just smells like a real food. As weird as it probably sounds, I like that it doesn't have sand in it, like most protein mixes. I know the sand used in other protein mixes is safe to consume, but I never really enjoyed the thought that I was drinking sand.I drink this type of stuff for sustenance, so I'm not too picky on the taste, but it actually has a decent taste. With 8 ounces of water, it's too thin to taste like much. 6 ounces of water and you can taste the chocolate a little more, it's good enough, but certainly not great. With 4 ounces of water, it just tastes like a hot chocolate drink that has cooled. This is the first protein powder I've tried where it actually tastes good with just 4 ounces of water. The less liquid I have to drink to get the protein I'm looking for, the happier I am. Others have more sugar or sugar substitute added so that it tastes better based on the 8 ounce standard. This has less sugar and so it can't support that much liquid and still taste good. I don't see it as a problem though because now it's just like a quick shot of chocolate protein and I'm good. Not some drink that I'm trying to choke down.My only complaint is the packaging. I can't stand these bags that some protein manufacturers use. Maybe it's more environmentally friendly, I don't know. I ended up pouring it into a large tupperware type container that's used for storing flour. Protein needs to be shaken up every now and then and it's risky to do so with these types of bags because they are very hard to seal. So put it in a solid contain so you can shake it up without flinging protein dust everywhere.Good stuff though. After 10 years of consuming maybe 30 different brands of protein, I think I've found a good one here.

It smells like cake mix! It blends like a dream, not gritty or chalky at all. It tastes pretty good, nice vanilla flavor. It is very sweet with a strong sugary aftertaste (that’s the stevia talking). The only issue I have is the sweetener discrepancy. The product photos of this listing show it's sweetened with monkfriuit, but the actual bag I received says stevia. I get migraines from sucralose/aspartame/acesulfame potassium, so it doesn’t matter too much whether it’s monkfruit or stevia. I prefer the taste of monkfruit over stevia though. This could be a deal breaker for individuals who have a sensitivity to stevia.

This product is great if you can just scarf down the drink. I used to use dymatize peanut butter and chocolate and that tasted 10x better for me.

The stevia sweetener really gives this protein a vile taste. I’ve tried many products and this was by far the hardest to enjoy. It really depends on how much you are comfortable with the taste of stevia but it is no unnatural tasting that I would rather have a small amount of normal sugar instead.

I'm a dark chocolate fan. This product lacks that chocolate punch...tastes more like milk chocolate. But to make it even worse, it is way too sweet. I purchased because it uses stevia, but stevia can be overpowering if overdone. They over did it. I'll be buying unflavored from now on. Since the price is also overdone, I'll be buying a different brand.

Not the best tasting protein I’ve had but def not the worst tasting, also need to factor in it doesn’t have all kinds of artificial flavors in it so all in all not too bad of a taste for the better ingredients. Don’t really like the packaging though. It’s a close seal like zip lock and all the protein gets stuck in it from the shipping so it wouldn’t close back up after opening the top off. Had to put into a different bag. Overall good protein for the quality.

To anyone who may come across this review,I ran out of my usual protein supply which is Forza Pro and is sold exclusively by Nutrishop (that I’m aware of) so I decided to go to the one down the street from my apartment. Turns out they were moving locations so I couldn’t get my usual protein. I went on Amazon and decided to purchase what I thought would be something that I could use to replace it in the meantime. I searched chocolate protein (I usually prefer chocolate flavored proteins) and came across this Ascent Native Fuel protein powder. Wanted some protein right away and it had next day shipping so I decided to give it a try without really reading too much on it or reading any reviews. All I saw was 120 calories for 25g of protein which is really pretty solid as far as protein powders go. I figured since it was $40 for 2lbs that it probably doesn’t taste too bad or anything. I was most definitely mistaken. It literally tastes like dirt mixed with cotton candy. I honestly can’t figure out the exact flavor but that’s the closest thing I can come up with to describe what it tastes like.I don’t even like to drink protein powders. I don’t like to make smoothies or anything, I mix it with water and just chug and I can tell you right now that it’s possibly the WORST tasting protein powder I’ve come across. I know that for the macros it has it’s hard to expect it to taste that good but this stuff actually tastes like dirt when I’m chugging it. And then when I finish I get this large aftertaste of cotton candy as if it’s going to make me go “wow now that’s great!”Now maybe it tastes better with milk or mixed into a smoothie but there are definitely other protein powders out there that I’ve had that have very similar macros and don’t taste nearly as bad. If you’re paying $40 for only 2lbs then it’d better taste pretty solid. For sure NOT getting this again. Going to just make sure to get my usual Forza Pro protein powder ahead of time before I run out so I don’t run into this issue again.EDIT: after reading some reviews I cannot believe that people are saying this stuff tastes great. They must literally have the most bland tastebuds on earth because this stuff actually tastes horrible. If you’re a normal human being that isn’t a gym freak on roids or Tren then don’t buy this ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.

The chocolate tastes great with just water, no milk necessary. But, please do not be fooled, you also need to workout to see results. I began drinking this every morning after doing three push ups and two jumping jacks.A month later I looked like The Rock, only stronger. I had to replace all of my doors because I would just pull the handles straight through the doors. I ended up removing doors from my house completely and using a bank vault door for my front door. Also, I can no longer drive my car because my foot went through the floor when I stepped on the gas. Fortunately, I run about 45mph from having insane quad strength so I no longer needed it. I simply crushed it down and carried it into my house. It makes a great coffee table, great conversation starter.Pro - Tastes great, worksCon - Could end up being too strong

The flavor of this protein is pretty decent, far from the best or worst I’ve ever had.  It is quite thick when mixed with milk for a blended shake, but easy to digest and healthy.  You can’t really beat the price.  I probably wouldn’t buy this protein again, however, because it doesn’t taste super natural and is lacking fortification of vitamins and minerals like many other whey proteins include that also taste better - for example, GNC and MuscleTech.Your mileage may vary but I’d say if you’re looking for a solid, standard chocolate peanut butter flavor shake on a budget this is a good one to go with.

I love Optimum Nutrition's Whey protein powders in general. I've never run into a flavor that is anything but great. This is the exception. The product claims to taste like chocolate and peanut butter. I can taste a vague chocolate flavor, but the overwhelming taste is somewhere between burnt peanuts and rancid peanut butter. I'm not sure how this passed taste testing, but it's absolutely awful. Again, I love Optimum Nutrition, but this is a miss.

I had a jar of this given to me to try and loved it. When I ran out I did a scan of the item and found it on Amazon. Everything is the same but the quality and taste is not the same. This did not have the same creamy chocolate/peanut butter flavor. The powder did not dissolve in my hot coffee the way it had before, (which I would make and shake in a shaker bottle) so I was drinking clumps in my coffee and a lot of sand.  I won’t say it was completely nasty but close. I will not buy this product here again.  When I requested to return the item I learned it was not reusable… so I am very disappointed overall. .

Unbiased Review here folks. The taste is wonderful, I mixed one scoop, almond milk, a teaspoon of peanut butter and half banana. I'm taking this for dinner and fasting 12-15 hours (this stuff along with a few protein bars, controls my hunger that long). The Taste is unbelievably delicious, have you ever had that one peanut butter protein drink at Jamba Juice? well, this taste as good as that one (if not better).  I've been on it for about 4 days, it gives me the extra boost at the gym (4-5 days a week, 1.5-hour workouts),  it relaxes my muscles. The following morning I wake up energetic, I haven't felt like this for years!  I'm 6' 2"", 280 lbs looking to get to my desired goal of 220lbs by the end of the year. I'm no bodybuilder, I'm just an average overweight guy looking to get back in shape, lose serious weight and strengthen my Arms, Chest, Shoulders, and lose belly Fat. I will update my review from time to time, as of now, I'm very pleased with this product.

Finally! I am so happy I found this protein powder. I used to by ""Oh Yeah"", but I think it was sold to another company. So after having a hard time trying to find it, I have been trying others. I have gone through several brands, and none impressed me. Most of them had an aftertaste. After researching and thank goodness to several positive reviews, I decided to try this one. I am so impressed! No after-taste, decent calories, high protein grams and the chocolate-peanut-butter taste sooo good.  I add half a banana and a tsp of honey peanut-butter (because I am extra) and who needs a candy bar when you got this? I will be trying the other flavors soon.

I'll try to keep this to the point but it may end up being long (skip to the end if you just want the summary).One day I was feeling lazy and didn't want to go to the store for my usual Protein, so I browsed on Amazon and found this. Huge amount of positive reviews (that I am now EXTREMELY skeptical of) so I decided to try it.Fast forward a few days to the order arriving. I'm immediately in love with the presentation, the black container is very solid, heavy and pleasing to the eye. I cracked open the container and immediately grinned; it smelled amazing! I excitedly blended it up (with milk) and took the first taste, expecting pure ambrosia.The results were...far poorer than expected. I have tried quite a few proteins in my day, and this one tasted the worst of them all by far. Imagine taking a cheap protein powder (which this is not BTW, it is actually fairly pricy) and storing it on the shelf for 5 years or so until it is good and expired. That's what this tastes like, expired inferior product.To add insult to injury, it makes you fairly gassy (it's not just me suddenly intaking a bunch of protein, I take my usual mix every day with no issues). As I write this, I have just given it the benefit of the doubt and tried three scoops with water just in case it was the milk affecting the taste. I am currently belching and have no doubt my gym peers will suffer as well this evening.In summary: Tastes terrible (tastes a lot like chemicals; this taste usually happens when food expires), gives you gas and is not cheap enough to justify just buying it for the protein and ignoring the side effects. This may be the first protein powder I actually throw out, it's that bad. If I could give zero stars I would.

I bought this specifically because of the protein-to-carb ratio.  I have another protein powder at home that has more carbs than protein.  I'm on a low carb diet and am having difficulty getting my 160g of protein without blowing my carbs out of the water.  At 24g protein to 4 g carbs, this is an excellent choice.I was floored the first time I mixed this in with some lukewarm water after my workout.  There were no clumps.  It was smooth, and was not chalky.  Even better.  It tasted good.  I just got done with a workout and mixed it in with some chocolate almond milk and it was DELICIOUS.

I'm convinced the reviews for this must be fake or somehow I got a bad batch because it is awful. I have tried many proteins, and this takes the cake as the grossest flavor. Even the vegan powders are better. I love peanut butter and I love chocolate, and obviously I don't expect the powder to taste the same, however, this is disgusting. Tastes more like dehydrated vodka than peanut or chocolate. I've been using the brand for a while and enjoy most of the flavors I have tried. But this is beyond bad.

I bought this chocolate peanut butter variety recently after having used other varieties of gold standard whey protein over the years. I figured, “hey, I like peanut butter AND chocolate, so this is a no brainer!” When I first opened the container I got a nice whiff of what, one can only assume, was artificial flavoring mixed with stale cardboard. But I thought, well, maybe it will be better once mixed in with some almond milk. So after I went ahead and mixed a scoop in with my standard drink shaker, the taste started to grip my taste buds without letting go. It tasted like one of my toddlers had vomited on my front porch, let it dry, ground it up, and mixed it with some cocoa powder. I am honestly unsure how any of these other reviewers find the chocolate peanut butter delicious. Did I just get a bad batch? Are my taste buds genetically predisposed to not likening this (apparently) popular flavor? Personally, I would by any other variety before this one.

I used to use ON whey protein powder all the time, so when I decided that I truly needed to get back in shape I bought some more ON.Yuck.I bought French Vanilla and Peanut Butter Chocolate and both have almost no taste and what taste there is is unappealing.  Also, I put it in a Ninja blender, and still, it didn't all blend.This can't be the same stuff that I remember.Other reviewers are saying that they think that ON changed formulas and that makes sense to me.  Others also complained about diarrhea and I have had some upset stomach issues in the past week that I've been using it.  It may be related and it may not, but the flavor alone is reason to skip this junk until they get things figured out.

It is a great protein powder. Tastes amazing and works with all sorts of combinations. I personally add a scoop into my oats almost every morning. I have not tried it with purely water and powder, but I imagine it is similar to other brands I’ve tried. It has a dinner texture which helps with blending and absorbing.

Normally, I'm hesitant about vanilla flavors, they usually taste very artificial and even bitter to me. This had a good promotion on it, so I jumped on it as I'm always getting protein powder and wanted to stock up. I found the flavor to be good, and mixability was crazy good. After shaking in a regular shaker for 20-30 seconds, no chunks or gritty texture whatsoever. Optimum Nutrition is already known for having a good quality protein powder, so I don't doubt its efficacy and will not say much on the quality of the protein since that's already known. Overall, this is a good way to stock up on a quality protein powder and save some money.

Flavour is great but perhaps the brand 'Legend' delivers a better product. The product can clump a little so needs a little more effort to mix compared to other brands.

Hii..bit about me --i practise Muay Thai along with Jujutsu. Mostly my workouts involve a lot of plyometrics, High Intensity Interval training (sprintiing and shadow boxing based) and lot of weight training (medium weights, high reps). Been working out for more then a decade now.In the past i would mostly try to get my proteins naturally (Milk, cottage cheese before sleeping, Eggs etc). it worked well but then i thought i had hit a plateau and whenever i tried to push myself more i would end up feeling tired the next day. This coupled with a day job made it difficult.Finally bit the bullet and bought the 10lb bag of ON gold standard (Vanilla, max servings among other flavors, also less of fillers from what i understand). I hate the taste of it as against Double chocolate version (tried earlier) but thats the leeast of my worriesI had considered a couple of other products as well (cheaper of course) but then i realized one ends up paying almost the same with them since the protein per serving ratio is way less then ON and hence the cost comes to the same almost. Also, ON manufactures all of its stuff in USA and extracts them there (no third party outsourcing) so that kind of tilted me in their favour..Difference / Observations --Things have started looking up no doubt. Able to shed that last bit of stubborn fat from the waist and i can go all nuclear on my ass with respect to workouts daily without that tiredness.Additionally, lactic acid buildup is down to a minimal and muscle definition plus growth is a definite YES.Word of caution -- i have been supplementing with L-Glutamine(early morning and late night) and BCAA's(pre, during and post workouts) as well (ON again). Me thinks that they have played some role in the overall improvement as well but then there are loads who believe GLutamine is just expensive Urine and BCAA's are useless since 1 serving of ON Whey already provides 5.5 gms BCAA's and rest one would get from their daily diet. (seperate review on Glutamine and BCAA's under the respective products).Also, i have been very strict with my diet as well off late so that is another reason for the vast improvements. (abs are made in the kitchen like they say :D)Rating -- 4.5 stars (i dont want those fillers in it but then thats impossible to avoid for this kind of protein right)Next in line --get rid of glutamine and BCAA's and jump to Creatine and Beta Alanine instead. this would be a game changer for sure. will sit on it for sometime and then take the plunge.(the water weight gain from creatine is a concern since i need to be faster more then bulkier)..

ON protein is in my opinion by far the best protein powder around, nothing compares to it and I mean NOTHING! The flavor is delicious, it blends well, there’s no grittiness to it, it doesn’t taste like plastic or chemical, nor does it smell like it and, there’s a good amount of protein being provided per scoop.My favorite flavors are vanilla ice cream and extreme milk chocolate, the smell is great and they taste delicious. I use protein powder as a ""supplement"" to my nutrition and fitness regimen. I’m not a fitness competitor or body builder but I do love to workout and have done a great job of building muscles so, having protein powder on hand as a supplement is important to me especially after I workout, I have a shake to feed my muscles immediately after. I’ve used ON for years but I’ve also tried a lot of protein powders by different brands (some good, some bad); I was even sponsored by two different well known sports nutrition supplement companies before but, nothing was as good as ON, I found myself going back to it and now I stick with it.I use one scoop of protein with unsweetened original almond milk, it tastes better than using water, I’m not a fan of any protein powder combined with water, it’s not as pleasant.I’m not sponsored by ON, nor do I get anything for leaving this review but as a consumer, I LOVE it! I also like reading reviews because it helps me when purchasing products so I do my best to leave reviews because I know it helps.The bag was completely sealed from the inside out, the scoop was just under the surface I didn't have to dig far to get it. The first scoop out of this bag went to my protein smoothie, yum!

This is the best protein powder out there hands down. I have been bodybuilding for years and tried various protein powders. It mixes easily with milk, almond milk, or water and tastes great. It also mixes extremely well with other fruits for smoothies. The only issue with the product I have over the years is the increase in prices. Hopefully if other customers like this review it will show we would like a price reduction in the protein we so desperately love. Cut the cost please!

Well, i have previously rated this protein in a different, worse flavor and gave it 5 stars, but after having tried the BSN Syntha-6 products, the most i can give it is 4/5, but that is in the flavor department. I can not put them at the sasme level. That would be unfair to Syntha-6 and anyone reading reviews to try to make a decision on a purchase.In terms of quality of the protein I think everybody knows this is a very high quality product. If you are training and are not supplementing with protein you are probably not at your 100% because the requirements of protein for a good balanced diet are way above the FDA suggested ranges. This product is very good for people trying to lose weight because it gives you a lot of protein and practically none carbs and fats. Mixed with one cup of skim milk tthe shake has barely 200 calories giving you a total of about 30grams of protein (24g the protein powder and 6-8 the milk).As i said, this is a very tasteful produt, but if you are trying to get something to make the protein comsumption delightful you need to look to Syntha6. You will have to pay a much higher price per dose though. That is why this product must be consider excvellent too: it is one of the cheapest protein that you can buy, making it very good bang gfor your buck.

First off, the seller is great. Got the product in perfect condition in a timely manner. (Two days for me w/ PRIME.)The protein tastes as good as any other whey I've ever had. It mixes very well and I just use a small shaker cup and water and/or milk. No clumps or anything with one scoop whey. So everything is as to be expected.My only issue is the bag. The seal is like that of a cheap plastic ziplock bag. For me, opening this once or twice a day, the seal just doesn't seem to last. Once the seal doesn't close tightly, the protein takes on a bad taste (probably it going bad huh? haha), but I usually just stomach through it. I have left over 5 lb tubs, so what I do know is just dump in straight into the 5lb tubs and store it with those. A friend of mine just uses one 5 lb tub, and then wraps and seals the 10 lb bag, until done with the other.Either way I recommend you look into a new way to store it, but really I think Optimum Nutrition is the best protein I've had. So far all the flavors have been decent. Just take into consideration what you may be mixing it with. Like don't buy coffee flavor to make fruit smoothies, :)

I love this powder. I’ve tried so many and this is by far the best, in terms of quality and results. Here are my 3 huge reasons to buy;1)Optimum Nutrition is an extremely legit company, and is constantly tested.2)The flavors are NOT bad. If you get vanilla don’t just mix it with water, add fruit/fruit juice and it tastes great.3)The Gold Standard includes 5.5g of BCAA’s and 4g of glutamine. This is amazing. Those are great for building muscle and recovery, and most protein powders don’t include them. A lot of people pay way extra for those, but this powder already had them...insane deal.

Not my first time to decide I have had enough with Gold Standard and decide to change with other Whey protein, not after very long I decide I have taken the wrong decision. I am an old gym fanatic who has been weight lifting for 8 years. Gold standard is a good choice for your if you are a beginner or someone who is trying to build adequate physique, probably not the best if you aim at taking parts in body building competitions, then you may need one with zero carbs.

Just received my 10 pound bag of vanilla ice cream gold standard whey. First things first, The bag weighs a little over 10 pounds and it is FILLED to the brim! that seems to be a major problem with protein lately is a huge tub only filled up half way, well that is not the case here.Taste, I love this stuff because its easy to slam down quick and in my opinion that is what a protein shake is for. I have some Amplified Wheybolic Extreme from gnc that I had to buy in a pinch a couple weeks ago and I can honestly say the Gold Standard stuff is unbelievably better... not only taste but how it mixes up and the serving size, I don't even wanna mention the cost lol, think the 3lb gnc wheybolic cost around $60 and I payed $97 for 10 POUNDS of gold standard...Needless to say I have found my go-to for protein now!

One of the better kind of Whey out there. I've been testing out other whey brands but Optimum Nutrion's product provides just the right balance. You'll know you are getting your money's worth when you buy this product. A week or two after using, I noticed that the gains I've been getting is  more than that of other whey powders I've tried. The vanilla flavor is not too shabby. Perfect addition to black coffee or a base for a shake. Get the 10lbs pack for maximum savings.

It's priced exactly what you'd expect for a 10lb bag. ON Whey is about the best balance between quality and cost, and calling it ""gold standard"" is very appropriate. Whatever your dietary goals are, you have very little carbs/fat and strictly protein. 110-120 calories a serving (excluding milk if you mix it with that), I'd think it to be a staple of whatever active lifestyle you have. I've been buying this for over ten years and don't plan to stop as long as they never change!

Upon reading about ON and their quality supplements, there wasn't a doubt in my mind that they are one of the top producers of whey protein in the market. Before I was using BSN Syntha-6, but wanted to try something different. So when I saw the 10 pound bag of ON Gold Standard, in the vanilla ice cream flavor, selling for around 80 bucks I jumped on it. I just received it in the mail today and am excited to start using. The reason I give it three stars is because when it was delivered the corner of the box was crushed. I'm not sure who's fault it is, but it caused a significant tear to the corner of the bag resulting in protein pouring out into the box.

I used to buy the 10lb vanilla icecream flavor for only one reason, it came with 154 24g servings instead of 140 or 139 like the other flavors. I beleive this was because it required less flavoring and coloring than the others so you would get more protein for 10 pounds of the powder in comparison to the other flavors. When I got mine the packaging was different and it said ""NEW AND IMPROVED GREAT TASTE"" and the servings per bag dropped to 146. I know that 8 servings isn't much of a difference but that is 192g less of protein that you are getting and the only reason I really bought this flavor was because of THE AMOUNT OF PROTEIN I was getting for what I pay, because flavor isn't what matters.

Completely and utterly disappointed with Optimum Nutrition. I jumped on a recent discount of the Ice Cream Vanilla flavor expecting to receive the same product. However, to my dismay they have pulled a fast one on me, and perhaps other consumers. They have branded their product with the infamous ""New, Improved Great Taste"" sticker. That was foreshadowing. A bad omen if anything. Upon checking the nutritional facts you find out that they have gone to the dark side and chosen to add more filler to the protein by reducing the protein-by-weight by 5%. If you were to compare it to a previous product (or maybe even the 10lb bag) you will be surprised to find that the protein-by-weight ratio is the original 82% and not the now 77%. Also, upon further comparison, you find more evidence to reinforce their probable protein spiking by looking at the serving size. The serving size has increased from 29.4G to 31G. You be the judge, but unfortunately for this company, I will no longer be purchasing from them any longer. I  may also seek to ensure my friends/co-workers/family are notified of such an esteemed product breaking down and following the crowd. I bounced between this product and an unflavored whey protein isolate from NOW, which I am definitely considering returning to. At least their product has not changed their ""formula"".

First, I am not a discriminate taster and this review is based on Vanilla proteins only. I seek a solid Cost to Quality deal over all others. With that being said, the ON Vanilla Ice Cream is by far the worst tasting protein I have ever tried. It tastes like a medicine that attempts to mask its ingredients.I am a huge fan of ON in general. The price is solid when you consider the level of BCAAs and Glutamine that are included. When it came time to replenish my Protein stocks several months ago, I came across a great deal on MET-RX Natural Vanilla Whey and decided to give it a try. Let me just say wow…that stuff is incredible. I use it in my veggie smoothies to mask the kale, broccoli, and spinach as well as pre and post workout shakes . With this ON Vanilla Ice, I have to add Gatoraid powder. MET-RX lacks the glutamine.So…..I would still by whichever protein has the cheapest price per serving. Stay away from ON Vanilla Ice Cream and if you can score MET-RX on sale, give it a try.

totally worthy of 5 stars,instant nutrition, adding more muscle, minimizing the fat to only whats needed to feed your muscles. we all tend to over indulge on a daily bases. have a large one of these shakes, in the morning, and go out have one large healthy meal, once a week. you'll feel great, get more done, be more creative and co-mingle more intelligently. free yourself of all that guilt. most of all, your more apt to get luck. i mean really lucky!.

I have worked as a personal trainer for many years and have tried all kinds of protein powder ranging from Walmart brands to GNC etc.  This is by far the best protein powder for making smoothies with.  Most powders blend weird or leave a funky taste in the drink but this blends smoothly and adds a nice vanilla flavor with none of the funkiness.  It also can be stirred well with milk (chocolate flavor makes a yummy chocolate milk!).

You can't go wrong with any product from Optimum. This is a great middle class protein powder if you don't want to splurge on Isopure or Hydrowhey. This is also pretty good tasting. I just wish there wasn't any artificial sweetener (sucralose). That is the main reason why alternate this protein with NOW whey isolate and Dymatize all natural whey.

Because it is an excellent deal -- approximately 85-90$ -- it lasts for months and taste excellent when mixed with fruits and honey.

The protein powder itself tastes great. Few things to know though:1. The included scoop only holds about 20 grams of powder when its full to the top. To get one serving (31g of powder) or the advertised 24 grams of protein, you need about 1.5 scoops2. The 10 lb bag has an awful zipper that breaks after 2-3 uses.

I've been buying the vanilla ice cream flavor for several years and on this last bag I found that they had ""improved"" the flavor. I'm sorry to report that it is very sweet. Not sure if this was one bad batch but that in itself would be a bad thing. Anyway, I've had to change my smoothie recipes to use a lot more tart berries to offset the sweetness. Drinking a shake made with milk is now barely bearable because it turns out so sweet.I'm giving this one star in the hope that ON might see this and give us back the old flavor. There are plenty of other over sweetened protein drinks out there, no need to have the vanilla ice cream flavor be one of them.

I have tasted other Gold Standard Whey Protein flavors and they were great. This is the first time I try Vanilla Ice Cream. Sad to say it has a bit of a chemical taste. I have to drink it really fast so I dont taste the ""chemical"" taste. Im still taking it as it is Whey Protein, but I dont get to enjoy this Protein Shake.

I started to not bother writing a review as this product already has a lot of favorable reviews. I decided to go ahead so I could tell my story.I initially started my weight loss journey in March of 2022. Mainly through intermittent fasting. I quickly started losing weight and I was ecstatic. At that point, feeling hyped up by the weight loss, I decided to join a local gym. My main focus was weight loss. I only really cared about seeing the numbers drop on the scale…and drop they did. I am 5’2 and my starting weight was 156. I have a small frame and have been anywhere from 103 (high school) to 122 (after having 2nd child). Most people felt 156 looked great on me…maybe so but to me it was too much. My stomach always stayed relatively flat, so the weight was in my thighs and butt.Anyway, I digress. So after joining the gym in May I was able to get my weight down to 128 by mid August. Although I was down to 128 my body didn’t look tone. I was thinking it was because of my age (45). I was disappointed as I thought that would just be the way it was.I ended up having a conversation with someone in the gym and they suggested I increase my protein intake and start focusing on weight training. I agreed. After about 2 months of consistent weight training (4-5x a week) and consistent whey protein intake my body started to transform. I COULD NOT believe it. Maybe subconsciously didn’t think it would work. I also increased my caloric intake as well because I was so focus initially on losing weight I was in a severe caloric deficit. I am now at about 130-132 and I’m am loving the way my body looks and feel. I’m not done sculpting yet but I am so excited to see what I’ll be looking like by May 2023, which be a year since starting the gym.I’m not trying to look like a pro body builder or anything like that, I just want to be nicely toned.I LOVE THIS WHEY PROTEIN. It is the way to go if you are trying to build muscle and tone. I ordered it in vanilla flavor and the taste isn’t bad. I definitely recommend! 👍🏾👍🏾

I am working toward a goal of a 1200lbs total in the big three lifts and purchased this for its more complete formula than my previous post workout shake. It has absolutely made my recovery more effective and helped me move closer to my goals. With that being said I'm not sure I'm thrilled with the taste (milk chocolate), its not terrible but its not great either. I would also say that my gut has suffered, and those around me have suffered for it as well, its a pretty common symptom of protein shakes but ive gone a while without experiencing it and i have not experienced it to this level before. Other than gastric distress this is a great product, if i find a way to mitigate that ill purchase this again.

This tastes like some fake medicine. The formula is so good with whey protein, creatine monohydrate, BCAAS, and Leucine. I got the MuscleTech Cookies n Cream flavor and I honestly recommend Dymatize Cookies n Cream because it has Whey Protein, BCAAS, and Leucine. The only thing its missing is Creatine Monohydrate. But, you can also buy that separately and have the dose in the morning before the workout. Then, have Dymatize Protein after workout to even the supplements out throughout the day. Overall, the formula is good but taste is bad and it’s better to get things separately and have them evenly throughout the day instead of having it all together at once.

I get cleaned up and ready, head down stairs and put in one scoop, blend, add ice, and enjoy the best shake I have ever had in my life.Thank you for this amazing product.P.S Keeps me full long after Lunch so I just have a bar and get a good dinner.

It’s kinda crazy how good this stuff works. It helps push right past the the uncomfortable first few minutes of working out and straight to the hood part. My favorite part is that not only does it increase gain but it maintains gains a week plus without lifting if you drink it every other day. Your going to want one of those shaker bottles with the metal thing inside though. This is a ‘shaken, not stirred’ product.

I have been using this product for a few years now and I really like it.  That said:  I am not sure what the company did but this last jar does NOT mix well at all.  It stays clumped.  If you mix it in a blender it mixes pretty well but there are times that you just do not want to pull out the blender.  So mixing it with a fork or spoon does not mix well at all.  Even if you use one of those mixing plastic jugs with the metal spring in it, it still is clumpy.  So whatever new was done they should go back to the old formula.  That is the reason for a 4 rating.  Really like the product execept for that.

This tastes about as bad as you can think compared to Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard's whey. Leaves the horrible chalky after tastes, sits at the top of your stomach after you're done drinking.

I am still relatively new to the gym and buying protein powders, but from what I have ordered, this is the best tasting powder by far. I have tried Optimum Nutrition's Cake Batter flavored Whey, Body Fortress's chocolate Whey, and XTend's vanilla ice cream Whey, and this one beats all of them buy a mile.I'm not a huge fan of making protein shakes, so instead, I like to find other ways to use protein powder. I start every day with a mug of coffee from my Keurig and add in a scoop of powder. Body Fortress's chocolate protein powder produced a lot of clumps of stubborn powder at the top of the coffee, and underneath, it didn't really do much to make the coffee taste like a mocha. It was alright, but it definitely didn't improve taste much. Nitro Tech, on the other hand, mixes perfectly into the coffee when stirred. There is still some of the froth at the top like Body Fortress, but it isn't nearly as much protein powder. On top of that, it tastes amazing! After passing through the frothy layer, it tastes like I mixed 50% hot chocolate with 50% coffee! For someone who doesn't like the taste of straight black coffee, this is an absolute win!Another use I like is to make protein pancakes! It's easy: add half a cup of milk, two eggs, and one scoop of your desired protein powder to a shaker bottle and shake until homogenous. Then, pour onto a pan on medium heat until they are ready to flip for three light, medium sized pancakes (or one large one if you're like me :) ). Again, this powder comes out on top! The chocolate taste is a little subtle, but sweet! And it doesn't have the clumping problem other powders have.If you are sitting on the fence about picking up this brand, I urge you: give it a try! Getting my daily protein isn't a chore anymore thanks to this stuff, and now I can focus on more important things, like getting these gains!

I personally don't have any food allergies and I have a tough stomach. I can eat almost all prepared foods.I read the reviews talking about people getting sick from drinking this, and that it tastes terrible, and I was really worried. The negative reviews are very scary! But I tried this anyway and I am SO GLAD I DID !!!I didn't have any problems with the taste or digestion. Its an excellent tasting product honestly and it gets the job done and its an excellent value for your money at 30g of protein / serving! I believe in this product and will be buying it monthly.Edit: I also want to comment on authenticity and respond to those who are saying this could be a fake powder. Just download the authenticator app (instructions on the bottle you will receive) and it will authenticate the powder for you. Follow the instructions and double check your work if you like. If it comes up as anything but authentic, then return the bottle!

Honestly I didn’t give it a fair shot (results wise) as I only used about 20 days worth. It was ok I liked that it had creatine as well, but too many ingredients I can’t pronounce (I did read before I bought but still wanted to try) how ever I just couldn’t get past the clumping. I have a 28oz blender bottle but even after shaking vigorously for a few minutes swallowing clips is just not for ME.

 Right out of the bag this may be one of the most delicious proteins I've had in a long time. It mixes extremely well and more importantly it sits well on my stomach or some of the other proteins I've had doesn't. I took a few pictures just to show you that after 24 hours there is no settling on the bottom of my mix cup like some of the cheap protein...meaning, if you have 3/8 of an inch settling on the bottom of your mix cup after you mix your protein you probably should look at getting another protein... just my opinion. I also took a short 16 second video that showed you how smooth the protein was there's no clumping it's not thick or thin it really does seem to be just the right consistency. I'm always a little skeptical of net weight so I actually weighed it and it came in just a tiny bit over 10 lb I should have taken a picture of that...lol... so far my recovery has been pretty great. I'm happy so far, we'll see how I feel after this 10 lb bag is done and whether I continue but it looks pretty good that I will be a reoccurring customer. Hope this helps.

I have strength trained all my life and am very disciplined.  I have always been in good shape.  Tried this product, and it does work.  You will bulk up some and gain a few extra pounds of muscle.  But you have to stay on it.  Once you stop taking it, any gains will be lost.  For my part, considering the cost, remembering to take it every day, it just isn't worth it.

WTF ??... also the consistency is far different from all of the other ones, I've taken it long enough to know that the texture and mixability is not right...i won't be buying again.. a damn shame but i no longer trust the product !!

I typically order the larger 4 pound container. Since there was a delay with availability and shipping, and the 2 pound was more readily available, I ordered it instead. I will not be making that mistake again. Although the same protein and same flavor, the taste is drastically different and overall awful. There is a bitter aftertaste, along with a ""medicine like"" flavor, as if some ingredient was old or past expiration. I've ordered the 4 pound container more times than I can count and I have not had this experience once. Next time, I will either wait on the shipping of the 4 pound container to or go with a different brand altogether. I just hope this is not a ""new and improved"" formula for the milk chocolate flavor.

Chocolate flavor is good, mixes easily in a shaker bottle. Texture is smoother if you let it sit for 15-20 minutes and then shake it up again. Great with ice, almond milk, a banana, and peanut butter powder!

Their Customer service sucks. There is never anyone available at their phone number and they never call you back. The first delivery I got of this, the container was already open. The Seal was from what I could tell never placed on the container. The second shipment, which I paid for showed up fine. But they have never addressed the issue with the first container being Opened. I like the product but this company doesn't appear to care about customer service. Hence the 3 star rating even though I like the product.

I'm not sure if MusleTech changed their receipe, or if I got a bad batch. I've been using their protein for nearly a year now, it had always tasted great, no problems.The batch I got last month was so sickening. It had a strange smell, and would make my stomach turn after drinking it. I'm going to order another batch, not from amazon, to see if there is a difference.Went from a 5 star product, to 2 star.

I've never left an Amazon review but I've been using this protein powder for over a year now, and there is just something way off about the taste of my most recent order I got delivered this week. It just has a weird salty/artificial after-taste that I haven't noticed before. It's not inedible just way worse than the last ""batch.""Very disappointing because I ordered 3 bins with the prime day deal.

My biggest pet peeves with protein powders are that weird after taste some powders have and not being able to dissolve completely in the milk. Before purchasing this, i was drinking Orgain vanilla protein powder with PBfit. At the time it was the only powder i could tolerate but it was not easily ""blendable"" with my blender bottle. I decided to try this flavor as i have heard a lot about this brand in the past couple months, and I've been pleasantly surprised! It tastes just like the milk that is left over after you eat fruity cereal and it also blended so easily; there were absolutely no clumps in my shake. The price is pretty average for what's on the market so overall I am happy with my purchase and I will most likely continue to buy this brand.

I know there are a ton of negative reviews on this product. After I ordered it I seen reviews of people receiving opened containers, product with bugs in it and other weird items, expired product etc. For me, I ordered the fruity pebbles flavor, mixed it with a plastic fork in milk just fine, no bugs, not expired and seems very high quality. I also noticed after taking my first serving, my stomach isn't bloated at all. It sits very easy on my stomach. The fruity pebble milk flavor is dead on. Taste just like milk after fruity pebbles. I will be ordering this instead of my ghost protein moving forward, I like the bcaas in it for post and recovery and it sits on my stomach better.

I used this protein powder for about 2 months. I originally bought this powder because it is third party tested and certified. Yet, I have found cheaper better tasting powders that are certified for almost half the price. In order to down this smoothie I could not drink it without peanut butter and chocolate syrup added. When I first got it I was curious and tried it only with water. That was a mistake it was so bad I had to dump it. Which really sucked because this stuff is not cheap. Between my husband and I we get 10 days of smoothies for one tub. The one I am currently using now gives us 8 but it ALOT cheaper. I will say this stuff is top quality and never upset my stomach. Honestly if the flavor was better I would have continued paying the higher price tag for it.

First time buying a powder protein. I am a 130 lb senior vegetarian, no meat very little fish, so I'm using for extra protein. I have to say it took me a full 10 minutes to get the cover unscrewed!! I ended up using rubber grip gloves and finally put one on the floor put the container on top of it and pushed down and finally got the cover off!!!! I tried it by using half a scoop in 8 oz. of almond milk in a shaker bottle and I have to say there were some lumps. The vanilla taste is not bad and I did not get an aftertaste.

I am not a fan of powders. I will sell my soul to get a premade protein drink rather than have powder, but as a mom with ever decreasing funds I sucked it up and settled on trying this one out next. After a long line of trying awful powders, I think I have found a brand I can stomach and flavor I actually like! So far I have tried this mixed with almond milk as just a regular shake with my blender ball and then mixed with a small amount of almond milk and thrown in my cup of coffee. Some might say that is disgusting and I fully thought it would be, however I was oh so pleasantly surprised. This is normally how I dink my coffee and protein in the morning (caffeine for my migraines)- not cold brew because I don't have time for that- and it was like a little cup of memories. I was not expecting to actually like it, so that was a huge win. It IS sweet and the pebbles bits are just that-bits in the powder-so expect those when you make it, however the taste and consistency are top notch.  110% recommend if you are on the fence.

Really good flavor! Love mixing this in with their chocolate peanut butter flavor.The only issue with this otherwise fantastic protein is that this version's caffeine is like...REALLY STRONG. It makes my heart thud and can even cause some very mild panic attack feelings if I do a bit over a single scoop (which, while ~110mg+ of caffeine, shouldn't feel that bad).I enjoy this as a half scoop with a full scoop of their regular non-caffeinated protein.

I would like to start off by saying this is NOT a paid ad (I wish It was considering how many containers I go through of ISO100 every year)I’ve ordered many flavors from ISO100 and the peanut butter flavor is very new to me and I was very skeptic of the flavor being similar to reese's cups like the reviews were saying. I’ve tried many protein powders and ISO 100 almost never fails me, it’s always smooth & doesn’t taste like chalk.  I ordered anyways to try for myself, and the flavor….

I’m caffeine sensitive so I’ve really been searching for something that sort of tastes like coffee without the sensitivity crash. This is it. It doesn’t even taste like protein which I loveeee. One thing I will say is, it doesn’t pair well with milk. In the fullness aspect. I drink unsweetened soy milk ((always use the unsweetened versions whenever using a protein that way you can taste it without the strong features of a plant milk))- **Just a tip in case anyone has trouble when it comes to using plant milks with proteins- Especially almond milk****mixing it with water is the best option. And the exact amount recommended. Overall, it’s bomb and worth the try. I literally  have to pace myself because I’d have 3-4 servings throughout day if I didn’t. This is it.

I was hesitant to ingest it at first because it smelled very dusty with a slight hint of coffee but once I tried it the flavor wasn’t bad. What I like to do now is put half a scoop of this flavor and half of the gourmet vanilla one and it taste pretty good. The vanilla one is too sweet by itself but the two flavors go surprisingly well together. The container can be misleading though. They do base the amount off weight but it’s basically half of the container. Maybe make the product size smaller so it’s easier to store?

love the taste the smoothness the richness...it literally came less than half full I suppose if you read the small print you'd know the ounces but the image is super deceiving and makes you think it's a regular size container. I buy a lot of proteins snd they're all almost to the top every brand I've ever bought so I didn't think to read the details I've bought many iso powders.  Other than that...I love it and despite the misleading size, I really like it and will definitely buy it again. They should really reduce e the price it's expensive for only the little bit in there but like I said I liked the taste a lot and they got me 😶‍🌫️

This brand is amazing! I love how it mixes, I love how it makes you feel afterwards. My only issue with this particular flavor is that it has a weird “smokey” smell to it when you’re mixing it. If you can get past that, it tastes great and I have no other problem with it!

ISO 100 by itself is a solid protein choice, dissolves well in both hot and cold drinks. Added to oatmeal is also a good way to go. But with that said, quality protein like this comes at a higher price, and not getting any cheaper. Hence the 4 star and 3 star value score. The Dunkin flavor and branding does add a little cost, but their flavor is pure Dunkin, which if you are a fan, you won't be disappointed.

Don’t be fooled by the other reviews saying you only get half a container. Sure, the container is filled only halfway, but you are still getting the 20 servings (and accurate amount of weight) it says the product has per container. I’m not sure why they chose to put it in a container way bigger than they need, but you are getting the correct amount. I, too, weighed the product myself just to double check, and it was the correct weight. Now, on to the actual powder- oh my gosh, this tastes JUST LIKE fruity pebbles! I can’t believe how amazing this tastes. It also blends extremely well, no clumping. Also no tummy issues. This is the best tasting (and best blending) protein powder I’ve had.

I’ve had the cocoa pebbles and it leaves me a little bloated (very little compared to other brands that aren’t isolate) I think it’s due to the chocolate or something. The Dunkin’ cappuccino is very tasty and does not leave me bloated at all. Very easy to digest.

This is hydrolyzed whey protein isolate. No protein in this product is derived from a concentrate form.You don't want whey concentrate. You want whey isolate. Hydrolyzed is even better. It will mix into water 💦, juice 🥤 or milk 🥛 with just a few spoon stairs. 8 oz should do it fine. 25g of high quality bioavailable whey protein isolate. Multiply that by 3 and you'll build lean muscle and lose weight (fat mostly) so you don't really even use the scale to judge yourself and consider your goal a failure or a successful venture.How do you look? You may have only lost 5 lbs. This can be deceiving. You may very well have lost 10 lbs... Of FAT! And... Replaced it with 5lb of lean muscle.Net loss 5lbsNet gain immeasurable.You'll literally feel better.. stronger 💪. More natural energy 😉Good luck. I'm an expert in this shit. This should be your base right here. You can bench press 225 lbs for a year. And not grow or improve all that much. I did it for 5 years age 19-25.

The double rich chocolate flavor is just not great. Taste is subjective so I don't want to be too harsh, but I just can't do this flavor. It makes me want to throw up almost. There's not enough of the flavor to the point where other ingredients became very prevalent in the taste.The product itself is nice being low-calorie, good amount of protein, etc. Just pick a flavor you think you'll like, and I think it's best to order the 1lb bag because you may just hate it from the start. You may as well save some money that way. Unfortunately, this kind of thing is just trial and error but I won't be picking double rich chocolate again.Editing this review to recommend mixing this with milk instead of water. Mixing with water was horrible. Mixing with milk? It's pretty enjoyable and tasty. Wish it dissolved a bit better though.

Whey protein is a mixture of proteins in whey, which is a byproduct of cheese production. It’s usually sold as a flavored powder, which is added to shakes, meal replacements, and protein bars.  Whey Protein Supplements Can Help Boost Your Protein and BCAA Intake. Proteins are the main building blocks of the human body. They’re used to make various important things, including tendons, organs and skin, as well as hormones, enzymes, neurotransmitters and various molecules. Proteins are also the building blocks of the contractile elements in your muscles. They’re assembled from amino acids, smaller molecules that are linked together like beads on a string. Some amino acids are produced by your body’s cells, while others are supplied by the food you eat. The ones that you must get from foods are termed essential amino acids. Proteins that supply all nine essential amino acids are the best, and whey protein is loaded with them. It’s particularly high in important branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) like leucine, and also contains a high amount of cysteine (7Trusted Source). Studies show that leucine is the most anabolic (growth-promoting) amino acid, and cysteine can help boost levels of the cellular antioxidant glutathione (8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source). Whey protein appears to be particularly effective at stimulating growth in humans. In fact, human breast milk is 60% whey, compared to 20% in cow’s milk (10Trusted Source). The main types of whey protein are concentrate, isolate and hydrolysate. They can vary in protein content, taste, digestibility and price. There is a lot of evidence that whey protein is effective at increasing muscle and strength gains, though some studies find no effect. Protein has been shown to aid weight loss by boosting metabolism and reducing appetite. Whey protein can help increase fat loss while preserving lean muscle mass. Whey is high in essential amino acids and other healthy nutrients. It’s also rich in the amino acid cysteine, which raises levels of the antioxidant glutathione and leads to many health benefits. Whey protein is very safe. A commonly recommended dose is 1–2 scoops (25–50 grams) per day.

Not a rich double chocolate flavor that's advertised. It's more like chocolate milk. If I used less milk the flavor was better. I can't imagine what it tastes like with water. I used a blender bottle to mix the shake. Sometimes there would still be undissolved powder at the bottom even when shaking the mixture with the blender ball vigorously. Don't count on it to keep you full for long, although it's protein, it's not much and it's still a fluid that doesn't keep you full for long.Another thing is that I tried the product with real milk, and it ended up having a sour taste. Maybe that was my taste buds because I don't like regular milk but it did taste a bit off to me.Packaging-wise I didn't like it. Like most products now, it was halfway full, the seal was a bit hard to close at first (maybe I'm just weak).OVERALL: As someone trying to lose weight, I will not purchase again for two reasons: 1) the flavor wasn't that great and 2)it didn't in any way shape or form control my hunger. I had the serving size (1 scoop -120 calories) and about a cup of soy milk (80 calories). I think it was just a waste of calories because fluid is so easy to digest so it doesn't keep you full which is the whole point of the protein. I might as well get those 24 - 30 grams of protein by eating REAL FOOD that will satiate my hunger for 3-4 hours instead of 1-2.

I am a weight lifter and I’m serious about my protein. This is by far the best tasting and mixing protein powder on the market in my opinion. I have tried to buy cheaper versions at the local outlet store and I end up with chunky protein shakes that taste like trash. From now on, I will only purchase only ON nutrition protein powder. I highly recommend this product.

1700,2913,Optimum-Nutrition-Standard-Double-Chocolate,2017-11-11,5.0,"Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey, Double Rich Chocolate, 1 Pound
Some background. I'm 55 years old and have not worked out since my army days in the 80s. Two years ago I had an attack of acute pancreatitis brought on by gall stones, which was fun. After spending a month in the hospital and gall bladder removal I recovered just fine. Except for the fact that any time I ate more than 6 to 10 ounces of very bland food I'd start feeling pain around my stomach and often would get very nauseous. This led me to eating lots of small meals throughout the day and way to much snacking. Over the two years I ballooned up from 185 lbs to 225 lbs. My doctor has not been able to figure out why the pain and nausea happens. They've poked. prodded, scoped every orifice, taken more blood than I honestly believe was necessary, and done every scan that they have a machine for. After finding no solution my doctor recommend I might try working out. It might help, it was very unlikely to make anything worse, and he's been wanting me to go the gym anyway.I've only been working out for 5 weeks now and taking this product for 3 weeks. And I feel great.First. The Gold Standard 100% Whey Double Chocolate tastes delicious. In milk it's just about as good as a chocolate milkshake. I have to resist the urge to drink more just for the enjoyment. In water it's not quite that good but still very tasty.Second. I only take it right after workouts which are usually 8 pm - 10 pm after work. I'm up for another 2 to 3 hours afterward and I am getting no cravings where in the past late night was my worst time for eating snacks.Third. After the first five weeks I've lost 12 lbs, feel great and look forward to the gym each day. I also so far, knock on wood, have not suffered from stomach pain or nausea in that time. I've felt the pain coming on twice at work after eating too much but after working out I've felt fine by the time I got home. In fact both times the feeling just faded unnoticed at some point during the workout. I'm still careful about what I eat but I have cautiously begun to allow myself more variety at lunch knowing I'd be heading to the gym later.I don't know how much the Gold Standard Whey is contributing to all the positive things I've listed here but I'll keep taking it. In fact I just ordered the 5lb tub. I like the flavor and look forward to having it after my workout. It has definitely cut back my late night cravings. And if it is feeding my muscles on top of that I simply don't know what more I could ask for. Simply put, I love this product and want to have it's babies.

Edit: Acesulfame Potassium is a necessary evil and much better than sucralose (at least that's what my stomach tells me).Unfortunately you cannot find an all natural protein powder with decent flavoring at a cheap cost or with the macros of ON Gold Standard whey. The only alternative is a grass fed whey product with cane sugar and cacao for $25 a 1lb bag with only 19g of protein per serving or mixing your own unflavored whey protein which just seems so tedious to me.I've decided since purchasing that organic protein powder that I'll consume ON's Gold Standard whey to augment the natural protein. You simply cannot find a better protein powder for this price with only one artificial sweetener. Also I looked into mixing my own glutamine and BCAA supplementation and noticed that I'd be forking out even more money so I'll opt for ON's Gold Standard Whey for now.Old Review:Well I thought based on the reviews that the Double Rich Chocolate version of ON's Gold Standard Whey was safe for consumption (for people with GI issues when eating artificial sweeteners) but I was dead wrong. Acesulfame Potassium is an artificial sweetener that's possibly worse than sucralose! Don't listen to the reviews stating that the Double Rich is still 'OK' if you struggle with bloat or indigestion when consuming artificial sweeteners.Unfortunately in the time that I've been out of the game so to speak (stopped weightlifting for 5 years) all of the sports nutrition companies have opted to include artificial sweeteners in their products. I cannot find a whey protein mix with real sugar which is so disappointing. I've opted for a brand that uses stevia even though I hate stevia but I guess I'll live with it.

The protein from the company of the leader of sports nutrition ON 100% Whey Gold Standart is almost the best of its kind among proteins. The protein has no shortcomings and dissolves well in water and milk (shaker or blender is better for mixing). The variety of flavors in this protein deserves respect, even the taste of vanilla is not sugary as in some other proteins. The protein/carbohydrate ratio is balanced to give the consumer the best possible results. It is preferable to consume this protein after 30 minutes of training, and it is also possible to use it in the morning, before training or at night, but it is not necessary. Also it is not necessary to replace completely with a protein shake your full diet, as it is only a food supplement.

I'm not a fan of flavored protein powder, almost as a rule. I prefer throwing matcha or fruit into the blender myself. I hate fake sugar, it usually upsets my stomach and makes me regret my life's choices.This brand's double chocolate flavor is one of the only I can enjoy. And believe me, I have tried a lot of different brands. Not only is it pretty tasty, it's ridiculously easy to blend. If I'm doing a heavy lifting session and need protein afterwards, I don't even have to wait to get home. I can just throw a scoop of this at the bottom of an empty water bottle, add water at the gym after my workout, and shake it to mix. I'm sure a blender ball would probably work better, but this stuff is so easy to mix that vigorous shaking does the trick for all but a few specks at the bottom.Protein powder should be easy; why bother with accessories unless you're planning on actually cooking real food? I like this because it indulges my laziness, tastes pretty good, and doesn't make my whole digestive tract try to explosively exit my body lest I be stupid enough to have it on an empty stomach.That's really all I ask for.

So I've always been a tiny size my whole life, like under 100 lbs tiny (& let me just say now that NO I am not anorexic/bulimic/ect.) I've always just had a REALLY hard time gaining weight. So that being said, I have tried a lot, and I mean A LOT of protein shakes. 99% of them have been so disgusting I don't even finish one glass and the rest of the container just goes wasted  because I never drink the stuff again. That is NOT the case for this stuff!!! I am super impressed, and it had exceeded my expectations 100% this stuff is actually good! Really good! I mixed it with whole milk, and it honestly tastes just like chocolate milk and has the same consistency, it isn't super thick or lumpy. I am so happy I finally found something that I can not only stand to drink, but enjoy drinking it!!!(Will update on how well it works. If I actually gain any weight)

This is my first time buying Whey, and I’m glad it was my first and best experience. At first I had to experiment with my combination for my shake, and when I finally found it, oh boy, it was delicious. At first my mother thought it would taste nasty, but she said it tasted just like chocolate milk, and she’s right, it did! It came with a scoop so I don’t have to worry about taking a big ol measuring cup and pouring mountains into my shake. The directions on the back might say to put in “X” amount of scoops depending on how many ounces are going into your shake, but I say experiment with it, find the right amount yourself along the way.Drinking a cold one after exercise is truly the best. I plan to buy more so I can continue my everlasting journey for transforming some of my fat into ABSOLUTE STRENGTH.

I like Gold Standard because it has really simple ingredients that don't weird me out.  Whey protein is milk, chocolate is tasty, I get that.  Other brands throw in all sorts of stuff I just don't understand or remove all flavor to get 0g of sugar.  I'm okay with 1g of fat and 1g of sugar to get a shake I enjoy the taste of!I use the occasional Double Chocolate shake when I want to recover after a big lift or am just have a day I feel fat and want to feel good about a meal.  It's not supposed to be a meal replacement but I find that having one instead of a big dinner can make me happy every now and again (probably not good to do regularly!)

I was looking for a chocolate protein powder with sufficient protein and low calories. Online searches brought me to this brand and I was not disappointed. I purchased the 1 pound to see if I liked it and I DO. I use this in the mornings, before work and after working out. Since I'm aiming towards weight loss, I keep my calories in check. I blend this into my morning smoothies with banana, oats, and Pb2 powder. It keeps me full until lunch (so around 5-6 hours) and allows me to enjoy dinners with the wiggle room I have due to the calories.I cannot say how well this blends in a shake bottle, as I use either a single-serving smoothie blender or normal blender to incorporate this product into my drinks. I feel as if it blends smoothly in a blender. I've also mixed this in with unflavored greek yogurt for extra protein in place of my morning smoothies and it incorporated fine with a spoon.

I also bought the 3 pack of Blender Bottles (with the wire, steel ball inside).This morning, after a 30 minute workout, a tiny amount of ice (sonic pellet style) in the bottom, 8+ oz of 2% milk, scoop of this whey, the ball, and 10+ seconds of shaking.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!  It is like drinking chocolate milk or even cold hot chocolate.  I have been full most of the day, no stomach pains (as a few others described), and there was no after taste.

This stuff was SO BAD. It made me want to vomit very time I tried to drink it. My husband had the same reaction, so it wasn't just me. We bought the 5lb container and had to throw the entire thing away. It smells horrific (spoiled milk mixed with chemicals anyone?). It's very thin (regardless of how much water I used, it was still thin) and was just gross. The ingredients on this product are good but I wouldn't recommend the double rich chocolate. Maybe If I had mixed it with milk, it would have worked, but I'm allergic to milk. That being said, it might work for you. Not for me. I'm going to try another flavor. I'll keep you updated.UPDATE: Okay so the double chocolate was really gross. Knowing that it is a very popular flavor, I might have gotten on e that was bad, I'm not sure. I purchased the strawberry delicious flavor from GNC and it is REALLY good. Just as I was expecting the first time haha. It is creamy, thick, doesn't smell bad and doesn't leave a weird after taste.

Purchased the small bag to test it out, as some of the other reviews had me concerned. Some were complaining that the formula changed, and that the new taste was bad. Others were saying that it is their favorite because of how incredible the flavor is (with others saying it was far too sweet).First of all, I will say that I like the taste. To describe one serving would be like when you were a kid and you didn't put enough Nesquik powder your the milk. The flavor is clearly chocolatey, but it isn't overpowering. As an adult, I really love this taste, and despite using Combat Vanilla for years, there is something about this that I occasionally craved. Because I have protein shakes predominantly in the mornings, I'm not looking for something too sweet. This gives me the feeling that I'm having a light chocolate milk without feeling like I overindulged. Though to call it ""double rich"" is certainly an overstatement!

Overall, I like this powder a lot better than than the Slim Fast powder I was using before and other powders I’ve tried. It doesn’t have as much of a fake sugar taste or any other weird after tastes either, at least not as much compared to some. It does say “instantized” so you can mix with a spoon but you really can’t or you’ll have lumps.. the pic was after vigorously stirring for a minute, ended up using a small whisk after. I mixed it with vanilla Almond breeze (the one with a touch of honey) and it was just barely sweet, which I like especially in the morning.

Honest review here on flavor. Vanilla Ice Cream was ehhh ok, best with almond milk. Double rich chocolate was ehhh as well, I would say it has a hint of chocolate taste but nothing I would want to try again. Will be returning that bag. BUT my fave is the peanut butter chocolate. Never fails me. Cures my hankering for sweets. I mix mine with some vanilla almond milk, PB2 and add in some frozen strawberries & you got yourself a cup of delish protein.

The Double Rich chocolate powder is really tasty and blends easily (I used a shaker cup).  Only complaint is that it could be clearer on the packaging.  It uses a man-made artificial sweetener which they ""hide"" behind using the chemical compound (acesulfame potassium) name which forces you to look up all the ingredients short of being a chemist.Overall, it is delicious and if you don't mind artificial sweeteners, I highly recommend this.I personally prefer natural sweeteners or none, so I will not be buying this again.

This is my first time trying whey. I didn't expect it to taste like chocolate milk since I've tasted other protein powders. Tasted fine and no clumps even though I used cold soy milk. I live in a dorm with no kitchen so all I have is a shaker bottle and the powder dissolved easily.

I got the Key Lime Pie and it's on point in flavor even if I mix it with matcha. Only complaint I have is that I wish they offered all flavors in all sizes. Think the two pound covers almost all flavors, but I really want to be able to have multiple flavors just sit on my counter without taking up half of it. Seriously, if they offered build your own variety packs I would jump on that deal so fast. As for those who keep saying the container is only half full, different flavors will vary in weight slightly. They have the standard large container to fit all powders since you are buying by WEIGHT not by package. Some flavors will be denser (like chocolate) than others causing the half full bottle. They also need there to be some room in the bottle for sifting since it is a powder much like flour.

Been using this powder for a few weeks now. The results have been great. I've seen more improvement, less down time, and more efficient workouts.Originally I accidentally ordered the wrong flavor, Vanilla Ice Cream, and it is very sweet. This flavor is sweetend with Sucralose and Ace-K.I wanted a flavor with much less sweetness and less added sweetener so I ordered the Double Rich Chocolate I originally intended to order. The flavor is awesome. You get a shake that tastes like an unsweetened Nesquik with all of the chocolate flavor.

I bought the double chocolate and can't taste or smell any chocolate in almond milk. The second day I tried whole milk and it is much better. I really don't want to drink it with whole milk till the bag is gone though, too many calories and too much fat. I am going to get some oat milk to try it with that. I won't buy this flavor again.

It's hard to say how effective the product is so I'll rate everything else. The taste is great. I've only mixed it with fat free milk and it tastes just like chocolate milk. You WILL need a mixer. It claims you don't need one but a spoon won't cut it. Shaking in my Blender Bottle removes all clumps.The packaging is fine. I'd prefer the plastic bottle with a larger opening. This one tends to close on your hand if you're not careful and you don't want your sweaty mitt touching the inside of the bag. The scoop is fine and sturdy. Buddies have complained about leaving old empty bottles out for a couple days and then smelling like something died in them. 3 days later it still smelled like chocolate milk so that's another plus for the lazy guys like me.

The flavorless version is good. Tastes a little like dried milk, but the taste is not offensive. The chocolate version is hideous. Tastes artificial. Way too sweet. Also, make sure the water is not too hot, or it basically boils the powder into clumps. It dissolves mostly fine in cold water.

The double chocolate tastes great. I saw people complaining about the taste and I don’t understand why. I work in a high end restaurant and if anything the powder tastes like a less sweet nesquick cocoa. One hold back is that it likes to foam up if put in a smoothie maker with fruits and such. When stirring into water it dissolves very easily, bit less so in milk still fine with a spoon and no shaker.

I was using his formula for a whole and then eventually switched to another brand after this one started getting bad reviews due to a change of ingredients.  The first one I switched to was the Muscle Pharm Combat whey.  To put it simply, it was disgusting.  So overly sweet that it was always difficult to finish. Then I switched to a plant based one.  I forget the name but it would always upset my stomach.  Finally I gave up and figured I'd try this one again.Well, I don't know what people are complaining about. It tastes fine.  Slightly less sweet than before I think? But mostly the same.

Looks: Like just about every other protein powder.Smells: Faint, rich chocolate scent.Tastes: Good flavor, but not much of it.  I found that a little extra power plus a teaspoon or so of sucralose substantially improves the taste.Feels: Not as filling as some I've tried, but acceptable as a post-workout drink.Bottom line: Ranks maybe in the upper third of whey powders I've tried.  Could use more flavor, and maybe a little fiber to bulk it out.  Four stars.

This is my favorite protein powder I've tried over the years. It has a distinct chocolatey flavor that you can control the intensity with the amount of water/milk you add.

I’m sure this has some top notch ingredients. Everything you need in a protein powder. The issue is so do other brands, and they don’t taste this bad, so why choke down something you don’t like when you don’t have to? I add some stevia to get it down because to me this tastes like unsweetened cocoa powder. I’ve mixed it with water, milk, and almond milk. Still blah. I’m giving 3 stars because while it tastes bad, it still works as it should (I’m guessing, as I haven’t sent it to a lab for testing or anything). For my money I recommend PEScience select protein. Tastes much better (cake pop especially).

Dissolves very well. Tastes very good. Not gritty.  Tastes like thick chocolate milk when mixed with milk. Tastes better than many others even when mixed with water.. Better finished result over Body Fortress Cookies and Cream.

I’ve steered away from protein powders because they tend to taste terrible. After reading many reviews of the rich chocolate flavor I decided to give it a try with the smallest size. It tastes amazing! There is no aftertaste which surprised me. I mix it with low calorie almond milk. Before my work out I throw it in the freezer for about an hour or so, let it defrost while I work out, add the powder and it tastes like a chocolate shake. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy drinking protein.

So tasty. I was worried about the reviews but I know I had this years ago and loved it, so I had to try it again. Tastes just like I remember.It's not easy to blend with just one of the shaking cups.

I've tried a few protein powders and this one is by far my favorite.  Tastes good, blends, well, and is decently priced in comparison to other brands.  I like to shake mine up with 8 ounces of Coconut milk post-workout.  I also chose this product because it doesn't contain sucralose. (Sucrolose gives me headaches.)  I know some of the other flavors may contain it, but the Chocolate doesn't and I hope that they keep it that way!

This is the best protein powder I've tried so far. The flavor is great and it mixed very easily with no clumps whatsoever. I thought it was too expensive to keep buying so I just purchased the chocolate body fortress instead. But it turns out the scoop size is almost double with body fortress so the price difference is actually negligible. Knowing that, I wish I had just purchased this powder again. The flavor is so much better.

This powder is awesome. It taste great in a smoothie, my favorite being banana, and shaken up in a Blender bottle. There isn't any chalkiness or gross texture either. It has very low sugar too, making it almost all protein for bulking up. Any person serious about getting big needs this product. Without all the heightened cholesterol and large fat intake your body is exposed to eating red meat to get protein, you can rest assured this is going to work sans health issues. I recommend it to anybody looking to build muscle mass.

I got this flavor because I was craving strawberry nesquik milk. The aroma from this powder is incredible when you open it and smell it. Unfortunately the taste is not as good, now. It's not bad but it's not as good as nesquik. I guess I should temper my expectations as it is a protein powder. However, the most daunting part of this powder is not its taste, but it's side effects. It gives me the most violent, consistent and frequent farts I've ever had. They are short, sometimes silent, and always deadly. I will try to return but if not I know what to give to my enemies.

I've read various info about being a diabetic and consuming protein powder so I might just chill on the protein powder use until I can get my diabetes under control. I know some times kidneys can have a hard time with releasing protein in the urine. Which is supposed to be bad. With that said. The taste is very good. None of that chalky taste or a bitter after taste like some powders. One reason I avoid stevia or aspartame sweetened products. It mixes well so that's a plus. No blender is even needed. Just a shaker will do. Over all I would give this a recommendation if someone is just seeking quality whey protein added to their diet. Whey usually ranks very high among various types of protein. There's not many nutrients in this stuff but this is a protein supplement that anyone can use. For that extra energy or building muscle. Any thing in between. It's an isolate so it shouldn't bother your stomach like some of the whey protein powder can.

When mixed with oatmeal it tastes a lot like Quaker’s strawberries & cream instant - but a little less sweet (which I prefer).It mixes really easily with no clumps ever. I’ve also use ON’s mint chocolate flavor which sometimes does clump. The powder for this one seems a lot finer (more like flour) which what I suspect makes it blend easier.Also other Whey proteins tend to upset my stomach but Optimum Nutrition’s stuff doesn’t for some reason.I mix it 1 cup of Oatmilk and 1/2 a cup of plain quick oats for part of my breakfast.

This is what it says it is - you can very much so taste the strawberry and the crème. I do mine with Skim milk so all the flavor really pops, but I like it! It’s a little overwhelming though so I may have to start doing half milk half water - we’ll see. The flavor profile is a little too intense and overly sweet sitting after you’re done drinking it, but for the price it’s good stuff. I’ll probably do a chocolate flavor next, but it’s good!UPDATE: been using it for a week twice a day and I’m getting a little sick of it… and word of warning tastes HORRIBLE with water. Milk only for this one. Probably gonna steer clear in the future.

Best flavor, I mixed it with Quakers high fiber maple and brown sugar oatmeal and highly recommend you do the same. Heat up the oatmeal first and then mix the powder in after.. you’ll have to add more water in than required for the oatmeal for the powder to mix in. It’s my daily breakfast and the macros are great.

This top of the line protein powder.  Tastes great and mixes easily.  Unfortunately, I have a dairy product reaction to it.  My body does not digest it well and if you have that sensitivity, this product will be a little hard on you.  If you do not have that allergy,  buy it!  It is top quality.

I love this brand and won’t be switching anytime soon! I have purchased the vanilla ice cream flavor in the past and wanted to mix it up this time around, so I went with strawberries and cream. I was a little nervous because I couldn’t find a ton of reviews on it but decided to give it a shot anyway. I’m glad I did. The flavor is sweet, but not too sweet, and it does have a creamy flavor to it. I mix mine with almond milk and it blends nicely, doesn’t leave think clumps of powder, and overall is a quality protein powder. I’d highly recommend this flavor and this company.

Wow wow wow!!! This is absolutely delicious!! I never write reviews, so if that doesn't say how good this is that I feel the need to write a review I dont know what will. I just got the strawberries and cream flavor today. I just shook it up with some milk and absolutely loved it, it tastes like a strawberry milkshake! I wasnt expecting to like it shaken up by itself, I was expecting to take a sip and taste a weird protein flavor then blend it into other things in a smoothie, but figured I should try it alone first. I am so glad I did! This doesn't need anything else, it is a game changer by itself. Highly recommend you try the strawberries and cream flavor if you want to just shake up some delicious strawberry milk.

I purchased strawberry & cream and it’s not bad.  For reference, I usually mix mine with water.  The strawberry & cream has more of a bland taste rather than flavorable but I kind of like for that fact because it’s not too far off from water itself.  My favorite would still be BSN Syntha-6 edge strawberry but if it wasn’t it stock then I’d easy buy this again.

I had used this brand for years off and on with other names brands. It is very good. It tastes good and blends very well in a shaker or in the blender. Most of the time I put it into a smoothie with spinach, Kale, with different types of fruits. I may add super greens powder in it. Over all it tastes great.Just a side note. No matter what type of protein powder you used you must put in the work if you want a nice body. This just an supplement. Not magic lol.

I needed this product for muscle recover after weight training. I tried the product as recommended but it immediately made me sick. I couldn't keep it down most likely due to the milk it contains and certain ingredients. It's not catered to sensitive stomachs, and my doc recommended I discontinue. However I wasn't aware it was non returnable, but now I am stuck with it. The seller won't let me return and wish they'd stand by their gold label. What shall I do with 2-3 pounds of this when I cannot drink it? So unfortunate. If the seller were to reach out it would make me incrediblyhappy knowing they stand by their product and it's quality. This could have been a quality issue, in which that's not my fault. Dear Seller, please step up and allow me to return.

I recently purchased this based on all the reviews I read and was somewhat disappointed in the taste. I do not like it as much as others are raving. I felt is was lacking in flavor. Vanilla Ice Cream is much better. Blending power is great though. I put it in the special cup I purchased and it always turns out perfect. Wish this had a little more strawberry flavor and not much a chemical flavor. I probably would not buy again based on flavor but instead would switch to another flavor by Optimum Nutrition.

Milk chocolate is good and I generally like gold standard protein but the peanut butter chocolate is disgusting. It doesn’t even resemble the taste of peanut butter. There is not even a derivative of peanut butter in the ingredients. Just tastes like a chemically laden failed lab experiment to create a peanut butter flavor.

The taste is absolutely on point with the Chocolate Peanutbutter, even with water instead of milk! The Mocha Cappuccino flavor was good too (not as great with water) but the Chocolate Peanutbutter is near perfect and if it was a normal drink I'd probably drink it just because it tastes good (a thicker drink with less water makes a big difference too, like smoothie viscosity). I don't even use milk anymore because I don't need it with this one to carry the taste and water cleans much faster. I drink this multiple times a day  and it's the only flavor I've ever tried that goes down without a hint of that gross protein flavor that most protein powders I've tried have. I'm almost done with my second 5 pound bucket and it hasn't been two months yet...Edit: I just opened my third 5 pounder of this stuff and drank some as usual, but something is way off... it smells of chemical/soap and tastes of it too, like the vat it was made in wasn’t rinsed after a cleaning. Right when I thought I had the perfect powder too.  Batch #0000955474. I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to waste time and resources returning a bad consumable product that should be thrown away, but the only service option is to return it.

Protein powders can be hit or miss. I’ve tried the EXTREME MILK CHOCOLATE which was my favorite protein powder flavor I’ve tried. I also ordered the CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER which I was not a fan of, tasted a bit bland. Overall a great protein powder and it’s nice that it comes in such a large container so I don’t have to order new ones all the time. I’ve been trying protein powders for about 6 years now and this is my favorite I’ve found.Another tip is to blend immediately rather than waiting and refrigerating, for some reason it doesn’t blend as well if I refrigerate it in my bottle first.

This is pretty much the pinnacle of modern protein powders, just about any bodybuilder,power lifter,strongman, or weightlifter is going to be using this brand (or they will have used it before). Now in all my experience of protein powders, anything that isn’t chocolate flavored likely tastes terrible (I’m not sure why that is but others seem to be of similar opinions). Now with all that being said it’s a nice protein powder and if you ever need a break from it I recommend the Rule 1 brand.

Protein levels are on par with other, less reputable brands but you are OPTIMUM! How about you guys do something and try to make the messy ass powder easier to use? Sure the protein is good but I'm sure everyone understands the powder mess that gets wasted consistently.  I've been on and off with this brand for a LONG time and feel they should have tried to improve something by now. The powder density, the scoop spoon, something!

Let me just say this; you can't go wrong with protein, no matter the taste.With that said, this is a weird flavor. I purchased chocolate peanut butter and didn't really know what to expect. I thought if anything it would just taste like chocolate and nothing else. I was wrong. This stuff has such a uniquely weird smell and taste that I still can't wrap my head around it. Sometimes it tastes like salsa, other times it tastes like corn or even carrots. It's not technically bad, but it's definitely not chocolate and peanut butter. To put things into perspective, I bought the 5lb tub and plan on consuming all of it. In no way is the flavor repulsive, but it's just not good. Hopefully that makes sense. I'd recommend the Chocolate Coconut or Chocolate Mint. Anything is better than this.

I've been using this brand (Optimum Nutrition) and it makes a good protein shake. Personally I use unflavored almond milk. I bought this thinking that they'd get the flavor right... nope, not for this one IMO (Chocolate Peanut Butter). It does taste like chocolate & peanut butter, but for me there is a weird taste that I can best describe as ""artificial"". It's tolerable but I don't think I'd buy this flavor again. I've enjoyed the ""cookies & cream"" and ""rocky road"" flavors in the past. Hopefully they can improve their recipe for this flavor in the future.

A friend of mine got me started on Gold Standard.  My first 5lb tub was the chocolate.  The flavor was fantastic, even with water.  Because of that experience, I didn't hesitate to order the Chocolate Peanut Butter.  Generally speaking Chocolate Peanut Butter is my favorite flavor of protein.  I was very excited to try this one.However, to say I was disappointed is an understatement.  It tastes nothing like Chocolate Peanut Butter.  The closest thing I can think to compare it to would be a very cheap version of shelf-stable fake cheese in a tin can that previously contained dog vomit.  I have drank it several times hoping it will grow on me, but it hasn't.  Normally my post workout protein shake feels like a reward for a good workout.  Now it just feels like punishment . . . and I still have 4.5 lbs of this.  I will definitely stick with ON Gold Standard, but NOT the Chocolate Peanut Butter.

I've tried four flavors of ON protein, and chocolate peanut butter is now my least favorite due to taste.  To me, it tastes somewhat bitter, like when a few burned peanuts make it through the screening process in a jar of shelled peanuts.  I'm tempted to return it.  I may try mixing with other ON proteins to reduce the bad flavor.I guess the low price (of the six flavors Amazon had in stock at the time of order) should have tipped me off that someone was trying to unload some bad product quickly.  I hope ON corrects this mistake.

This has rich chocolate and peanut butter flavor, plenty of protein, and there's a lot of servings in 1 container! The downside (and it's a big one) is that it does not mix well at all. I've tried water, milk, almond milk, cashew milk, rice milk, and coffee (all cold & hot) but still just clumps together once it touches the fluid. I've tried stirring, shakers, and blenders but this stuff just sticks to everything.

The Chocolate Peanut Butter protein powder is by far their best tasting flavor. That said, BE WARY of the ingredients on each different flavor, as they all differ. Chocolate Peanut Butter, in this case, has MALTODEXTRIN in it. I for one am disappointed, as it is my favorite flavor so far, but I will never buy it again. Maltodextrin, as you may know, if you're educated in nutrition at least, is by far the worst sweetener known to the world right now, with the highest glycemic index. If you don't know what that is, it means it spikes your insulin higher than any other sweetener out there. Table sugar is a 65, and maltodextrin is typically 110, to put it in perspective. Just use table sugar in your flavor if you want to cause slow diabetes, Optimum Nutrition, not maltodextrin, which will ROCKET people into diabetes.

First, let me just say I've tried most of the flavors of this protein powder. Double rich chocolate, French vanilla, vanilla ice cream, cookies and cream, even coffee and all were very good. The chocolate peanut butter is not good at all. It has a strange, almost chemical aftertaste. It doesn't really taste like chocolate or peanut butter for that matter. This formula also seems to be a bit finer than the others. I also bought a 5 pound tub... so wish me luck getting through this.

I ordered the 5lb. Chocolate Peanut Butter flavor twice over the past 2-3 months. The first one I received tasted and smelled great, had no issues. I ordered another one last week and the smell and taste was completely different. It had a very weird smell to it and I was nauseous and sick within an hour of drinking it. I felt completely fine after a couple hours and decided to try it again the next day to make sure it was the shake and not something I ate. Again, I was nauseous and getting sick. Not sure if I got a bad batch or if the seal was compromised during shipping or what. I've seen a lot of similar reviews are they are correct. You don't know if you're going to get a good or bad product. Not worth the risk just go to a store that carries it. I was able to get my money back and bought the same product from GNC which I am currently using and it tastes great.

I've used this Whey Protein for years mostly the dark rich chocolate.  I decided to try the Chocolate Peanut Butter and it was a big mistake, never again.  In order to tolerate the taste you need to mix in natural peanut butter or some other mixture to mask the flavor.  Whomever designed this flavor, should be fired.  I will continue to use ON Whey Protein but not this flavor.

Am I the only one that thinks the peanut butter flavor taste like dirt? At first I thought it tasted like what old socks smell like, but then I thought more like dirt. Honestly, I love double fudge flavor but decided to try peanut butter flavor because I love chocolate and peanut butter. I don’t understand people gave it five stars for the flavor category. I’m guessing their taste buds are out of whack. It made me feel nauseous.  By the way, what does the blending powder category mean?

I got the chocolate peanut butter. It tastes great for a split second, and then a horrible chemically aftertaste hits you. I did some research to make sure I wasn't poisoning myself and it seems like it's caused from high amounts of sucralose in the powder.

I bought this to put in coffee. I've been doing the low-carb diet for like 8 months & I'm still trying to find my groove. I eat many veggies & can stay in ketosis well but with some of my health issues loss is very slow. I've lost 35 lbs though so I'm sticking to it. I would always go up and down a couple pounds every couple days . I was happy just not to gain so I haven't stressed it. Well I started using this protein (only like a month cause I only use one scoop) and while I stay in ketosis, I went up 4.5 lbs in a 2wks. I didn't understand & then decided to stop this in my coffee, within a week I've lost those extra LBs again. Something in this stuff stalls my loss and had me gaining a tiny bit. Just fyi. If your low carb and still trying to lose/having issues, try cutting this. I don't love breakfast, so having protein coffee was perfect and filling but it's not working in my low carb goals.

Some of these protein powders are both expensive and laden with sugar. We as Americans know the game, add sugar and everyone likes it. This has lower sugar than most (1 gram per serving) 30 grams of protein and is 150 calories. I mixed mine with unsweetened almond milk (Kirkland brand from Costco) and mixed it in a small blender. It turned out creamy and like a milkshake, which was great as a breakfast drink replacement. The trick is to be satisfied with just that in order to lose weight. I am working on that part. It is initially filling, but if you are like me, an hour later you're saying, ""what else is for breakfast"". That is just me.

I'm surprised at many of the other reviews, it's like people are getting a different product then I did.I think this whey is great, though I never had it in bottle form so can't compare it to that. Bottled premixed shakes are almost always different and overall better then the shakes made at home but its always been that way so should be expected. People saying this ""doesn't taste like coffee"" but the flavor isn't even coffee, it's cafe latte. I assumed it would taste something like coffee and it sort of does. To me is tastes like the smell of coffee you'd smell walking through a mall. It's a great whey and PP is one of the few brands that don't use soy.Only complaint is it doesn't mix all that well, though for me making a shake consists of putting 2 scoops in a water-bottle via funnel after taking a few sips out of it and shaking it. I noticed over the years this method works easy with some brand/flavors and not with others. I still recommend it highly though, just don't expect it to taste like starbucks mocha whatever it's called and use a blender!

I usually drink the pre-made bottled product. I happened to see the powder and thought I would try it since the Cafe Latte is my favorite flavor. Also, the bottled drink has gotten way too expensive. I think the flavor is really good. However, I am confused as to how much to use. The container directions say to use 2 scoops, the directions in the write up of the product say to use 1 scoop. Which is correct? I do believe I am going to use more liquid as I find 2 scoops of the powder to be very sweet.

This product is not to be used to help you lose weight. It is meant to be used as a meal supplement/replacement when you just don't feel like preparing food. While instructions recommend using water to mix in order to keep the calorie at a minimum, I used it with water and ¼ cup of whipping heavy cream. I am on a carnivore/keravore diet, so extra fats are ok for this diet. And heavy whipping crean have virtually no sugars.

I use this protein powder to make my daily protein shake which includes 39g of protein powder, 50g of oat, 55g of nonfat Greek yogurt, 70g of frozen blueberries, and either choices of water or whole milk. It gives me approximately 500 calories and 50g of protein with milk. At first, I was using milk, but the powder didn't blend well with milk, so I switched to water, and drank milk on the side. The flavor is good, but somehow it gets really sweet with milk.

I loved the pre-packaged cafe latte protein shakes so I thought I would save some money and buy the powder. Just want to start out by saying that they don't taste the same; blended with water, the protein-powder version drink tastes almost like butter, which becomes off-putting after a while, but definitely nice to switch it up now and then between this one and another protein powder that I like. Blends well. Price is ok, although its annoying how you are paying for a huge plastic bottle that's basically half full. Not saying you're not getting what it says on the packaging, but the size is misleading!

It is easy to get good amount of protein when you trying to fulfill your daily macro nutrients. 30g per serving is a lot, and works for me. It does take some blending to mix the protein powder.

The day I ordered this I just got diagnosed with diabetes and I really needed to make a change in my diet, but, I have a huge issue with sweets.  I knew that abstaining from sweets was just not going to work with me.  I bought this due to the price cause I was low on money and most diabetic shakes cost about double of this brand.  It was delivered the very next day and I immediately tried it.  I put the water, ice and powder in my Blend Jet and at first taste I was amazed, it actually taste really good, has a bit of an after-taste to it but not that much and its very filling which is another upside to this shake as a snack and meal substitute.  I could really live with this and it will help get my sugar and sweet cravings under control.  I even added a scoop of the mix to a cup of coffee (cause I can't have flavored coffees anymore) and it was Delicious!!  I'm very grateful!

So... I was waiting for this to go on sale (original price after tax was around $30 for this) and I got it on sale for $17 after tax.The product is fresh, was sealed properly, tastes good, etc (doesnt mix well, though...) What I recieved was an only HALF full container. In the photo, this hasn't been opened. I held it up to the light and lo and behold!!! Half full.I can't imagine spending FULL price on a HALF full container! Waste of plastic, ya know? (and cash...) But, for it being on sale it was worth it! I'm sorry for those who spent the full price to receive half a container.

This is my favorite flavor of Premier Protein. I love the flavor and add espresso shots to it, iced, daily. I bought the powdered version to have on hand for camping/random times when I don't have a carton around. The price for the powder is the same as the pre-prepared cartons. So it's not saving any money, but I can easily add a scoop if I need to, to random items (great in overnight oats). If added to a bottle at the top, it doesn't always shake up and blend in as easily as I would like. Overall I like this product, just wish it wasn't the same price as pre-prepared drinks.

I had been buying Premier Protein prepared drinks from Costco in the 18-pack for years. With the onset of the pandemic and prices going nuts all over I decided to give the powder a try. One of the biggest pros in my book is less single-serving waste  - these containers are recyclable plastic. The flavor is on par with the packaged drinks (be sure not to use too much water - 6 ounces will do just fine!) but the most obnoxious thing I have noticed is the need to use a blender. I have tried every alternative to NOT run the blender at o’dark thirty, including making the night before (product settled weird if you let it sit after mixing), shaker-blender bottle with the metal mixer ball (leaves in-blended gobs) and even hand-mixing with a whisk (not sure how I thought this would be more effective than the blender-shaker bottle). The only thing that blends this to a smooth mixture is a proper blender (or smaller version, like a Nutri Ninja).

I’ve bought the prepackaged small ones for months and decided it may be cheaper to buy the whole container and make my own shakes. I use sugar-free almond milk and the taste slightly like chocolate milk but not a nasty chalktaste like other protein shakes. I have a blender shake bottle that has the metal wisp in it. I recommend having a bottle with that because it does get clumped up if you don’t shake it well.

I have been a pre mix user as it a fantastic way to get one of the better protien per gram to calorie ratios.  So seeing the powder version I thought I would give it a try even knowing often the powder version are worse and to be clear it is.Now the powder is cheaper than the premade ( premade being 18 servings for $33 versus powder 17 servings for $21) that said it is nowhere near as flavorful.With water it tastes like nothing, with milk I never tried, but even with the calorically cheapest Almond milk (around 40 calories for 12 fl oz) the point of 150-160 calorie efficiency is gone.Mixing it with coffee is the closest it gets to the Premade but still is not as creamy, but is enjoyable at that point.As mentioned by others the containers are huge but half filled, but apparently that the nature of these after the powder settlesI recommend the powder if you already drink coffee in the morning this is decent but the premade is still my recommendation

One of the best protein powders for me. Low sugar, low salt, great taste, blends well. Perfect for people with dietary restrictions. Mixes very well with other powders like ginkoba and beetroot. Good chocolate flavor without being overly sweet. If you mix it with milk or vanilla ice cream, its similar in taste to the Wendy's frosty.

Did NOT expect to like the flavor this much!!! Literally the best protein powder I’ve had thus far. Ran out of my Strawberry flavor (that was so good with either milk or plain water) and decided to try the cookies and cream flavor to change it up. This brand never disappoints! Excellent source of protein when you’re struggling getting the amount you need in a day. Mixed well and did not have a chalky taste. Blend with a cup of almond milk and 1/3 of a banana (I used the black ones in my fridge smh) and it was the best smoothie I’ve ever had. Great reward after a hard workout! Buy it!!

This saved my bacon when I could not eat and we needed it, but the flavor was a bit strange and gave it a weird texture with the cookie crumbs. I felt them in my mouth for an hour after each time I drank it. I got through it OK and the good thing is we found out that you can buy the same thing in many different brands and flavors for the same price or cheaper at the local supermarket.  Be careful though if you are drinking this as a meal supplement since it has a very limited amount of vitamins in it. There are far better options. I am allergic to B6 and this has none so I went with this. It is a good source of pure protein and a good supplement for working out and it will give you an extra boost if need be so it has a place in your diet if you need it.

I have tried 3 flavors of this stuff, Rocky Road, Mocha and Cookies and Cream. Best one is Rocky Road, followed by Cookies and Cream and then Mocha. The Mocha is not bad, but it just doesn't really taste like coffee, and I find fake coffee flavor to be a bit off-putting. Cookies and Cream does have the little bits of ""cookie"" in there, but I actually kind of like that. Especially for smoothies. Rocky Road is a delicious concoction that does actually taste like it could be dessert. I followed that one review that claimed it was the best flavor and I believe them.I think this powder is very reasonably priced. I take one scoop a day, and one of the tubs lasts me about a month. There are cheaper options, but they taste terrible or don't mix well. Speaking of which, this mixes wonderfully in my shaker bottle. I never get clumps or anything weird.I'm just going to trust the other reviewers who vouch for the quality of the protein. I have tried other brands that have that all organic, no preservative, vegetarian powder. But the problem is that it tastes terrible and doesn't mix well. I couldnt even finish some of the other brands. I make sacrifices for my health, but I draw the line at quickly swallowing a shaker bottle filled with clumpy powerdery protein that tastes like it should be inedible. This one however, makes the experience pleasant.Overall, I think this is a sold, quality product and I'm going to keep repurchasing it.

I’ve had a cookies & cream protein shake (that’s now discontinued by the manufacturer) that I loved.  It actually had bits of cookie in it that didn’t dissolve unless you mixed it ahead.Now I’m searching for a comparable protein powder and sadly this is not it.This product is probably very good for those who like a rich vanilla with hints of chocolate.  It looks like vanilla in the canister.  After mixing, it still looks like vanilla, but with a tiny amount of brown specks in the bottom.After looking at other protein powders online, I saw one that commenters on mixing instructions noted that only 4oz of water/milk was recommended per scoop.  Even though this protein powder does recommend 8oz, I tried doubling the amount of powder for the 8 oz.  the only difference I noticed was a bit more brown particles in the bottom of my shaker bottle.I’m kinda picky and don’t prefer plain vanilla, so I will try returning this & try yet another brand.

On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being best ranked, I’d rank this protein as a 7. The ingredients are good but the taste and consistency are not the greatest. I know isolate tends to be a little grainier, but somehow that seems to also affect the flavor. That being said, it mixes well in my morning oatmeal and with water as a shake. Good source of whey isolate, I‘be just been spoiled by more expensive ones (hence my choice here).

This review is only regarding flavors. So far I've had 3 different ones.Strawberry: taste like Strawberry Nesquik with milk/water. Great for shakes. Guaranteed yum.Double Rich Chocolate: Absolutely delicious. Not too sweet or chocolatey. Taste like the perfect chocolate milk. 10/10 would recommend if you're feeling basic.Cookies N Cream: WOW. This took a couple drinks to get used to. It taste like someone took all 3 packs of Oreos, removed the filling, put it in a blender with water (or milk) and mixed it together. Definitely more of a Cream with a dash Cookie kind of flavor. It's the kind of sweetness that makes your mouth go dry. Don't recommend for fruit/veggie shakes, unless you're into that sort of thing. With thing defined here as something seriously weird and unsettling.

I have been trying to find a whey protein flavor that i actually could learn to love.  In the past i've bought GNC's and as much as i know the quality is good i just can't stand the taste.  This brand (ON) as well as this particular flavor when mixed with milk (vanilla or chocolate) works really well for me.Here's my rating in terms of flavor (1 lowest - 5 highest):GNC Chocolate - 1.5ON Banana - 3.8ON Cookies and Cream - 4.0For the packaging it came sealed and was delivered on time.I also found the powder for ON easier to mix with water and milk (using my blender bottle) as opposed to GNC's.I'm happy with the purchase and will most likely order again as well as try other flavors (french vanilla, strawberry banana, etc.)

Well, I haven't been lifting that long, so I can't give too much info on this, but as far as the taste, and mixing goes, it all gets 5 stars. I bought a BlenderBottle along with this purchase, so as far as the mixture goes, that is the source in which I am using.I shook for about 30 seconds, and there were not any clumps, or any signs of bad mixture quality.As far as the taste of Cookies & Cream goes, it doesn't really taste like cookies & cream, but the taste is still pretty good. I'm using one scoop of the protein, and 8 oz of water. The taste is kind of odd, because it comes after you swallow, so sort of an after taste, but nevertheless it is good. I'll be trying with milk tomorrow, so I'll update which is better. If you are worried about the extra calories associated with mixing with milk, don't worry, the water mixture taste is still top notch.Taste - 5/5Mixture 5/5

I really like this powder.It's promoted and known to be the highest quality protein powder as far as I know.It's my first time buying a protein powder, and I think it's worth the investment, since I know I won't be inserting anything unhealthy into my body.I bought a 2 pound tub of ""Cookies and cream"", and to be honest I quite dislike the taste (although after a workout, being thirsty, I can finish it pretty quickly regardless of the taste).I'd recommend going for the Vanilla one for a first tub, as there are a lot of yogurt/fruity smoothies you can make with it.Also, I wouldn't suggest going for a big tub on the first few purchases, at least not until you've chosen the taste you like the most.** Something I wasn't sure of before purchasing it: IT DOES come with a scoop!

4 stars for the great macros. I ordered the cookies and cream flavor and I will not repurchase this flavor. The cookies and cream flavor is overwhelmingly sweet (and I LOVE sweet) and the only way to get rid of the chunks is to blend it in my ninja blender for at least 30 seconds. When I use this protein in a standard shaker bottle, I can't shake out the chunks. This is the only flavor that has complaints about it being chunky. I have one or two scoops left before I can order a different flavor, which is going to be rocky road. You can't go wrong with optimum nutrition, even the cookies and cream wasn't TERRIBLE. I drank the whole tub anyways!

When I got it the protein was sealed on the outside but on the inside of the cap there wasn’t a seal and it was about half full. I’ve bought 100% whey before but it’s been a while so I cannot remember whether or not it was sealed under the cap and whether or not they filled it more than half way (possibly since is determined on weight rather than capacity). Other than that I’ve always enjoyed this supplement the past times I’ve bought it.

TLDR: get a different flavor than cookies n cream it’s nasty, others are greatI’ve been using gold standard for a few months now to help me to get enough protein. I (20M, 6’, ~200lb) have put on an amount of muscle I am very satisfied of while becoming more cut at the same time (although definitely increased in weight too). I definitely attribute this at least partially to my use of protein powder in conjunction with going to the gym and setting macro/caloric goals.This time I tried getting cookies and cream and well, it makes me want to throw up. With my previous flavors I enjoyed the drink, going so far as to say I liked the flavor so much I could have drank it just for the flavor alone. However, the cookies and cream is so vile it makes me feel nauseous; to get it all down I can’t sip on it, I need to chug the entire bottle (I usually do 3 scoops, ~90 grams of powder and ~ 22 oz of water). Needless to say I will be getting a different flavor next time. I’m unsure if I’ll even be able finish this tub

I'm writing this review ONLY based on the flavor. There's numerous other reviews that talk about the benefits and you can always just look at the label. I ordered the cookies and cream flavor with high hopes. After already ordering my 2 lbs I began to look at the reviews for that particular flavor (I know, rookie mistake). It seemed as if no one liked the cookies n cream but I decided to try it anyways wants it arrived. I love it! It doesn't take exactly like cookies and cream but it does taste somewhat like a sugar cookie. There are little pieces of brown ""cookie"" in the powder that could easily be picked out if you wanted to. I do advise though that this powder is extremely sweet and that not many people like that when looking for a post-workout shake. Hope I was able to help.

This is by far the best protein powder I've used to date. All other powders I've tried have a funny or nasty after taste that I just assumed was the protein itself but not this protein powder.

I bought this for my son of 15 years of age.  He had just started to workout with weights to build muscle.  I wanted to get him on some protein and he was told by some older school friends that this was a great flavor.  So I purchased it.  It must be great as he is on his second container.  He said he puts a scoop in a blender bottle and takes to cafeteria at his school and adds milk and had prior to having dinner.  He said he loves it.  Protein is a necessity for kids getting into lifting weights to build muscle.  It will help elevate the soreness that comes after a workout.

I've been working out for about 8 months but I just started using protein shakes recently...I was told that this was a reputable brand...when I got my 2 lb of cookies & cream the tub was not filled to the brim like I thought it would be but then I realized the tub was the same size as the 3lb I got of another brand...I weighted it myself & it was actually 2 lbs...I think ON uses the same size tub & just puts the desired amount & label based on the order...taste was phenomenal with milk & water

I originally intended to buy vanilla, but saw that this was slightly cheaper and it looked interesting. It didn't taste like cookies and cream to me; much more like vanilla. It works out for me in the end.

I like this brand and flavor (although I haven't tried another flavor yet) for these reasons:1) It tastes pretty good in milk-no overpowering ""protein taste"" and only a subtle flavoring.2) According to ConsumerReports research (google ""Consumer Reports protein drinks"" and it should be the first link), Optimum Nutrition is very good about keeping down the amounts of dangerous heavy metals in their products.3)It's high in protein, including most of the essential amino acids, but it doesn't have a lot of carbs.  Carbs are necessary for post-workout recovery, but this allows me to control my carb intake much more easily.What's not to love.  I can't guarantee that you'll like the flavor, but you won't know until you try.

The Cookies and Cream flavor is amazing!!! I'm not a big fan of protein drinks normally. Plus I am not a chocolate fan, which most protein powders are chocolate flavored. My friend told me about this product/flavor combo and I decided to try it out. Amazon had a great deal on it so I ordered a 2 lb. container. I was shocked by how good it was. No chalky taste! I tried with both almond milk and water, which I liked the water better. I added ice because I found it tasted better. Would definitely purchase again. Think I'll try the salted caramel next.

I've tried a few different proteins over the last few years and I had thought that EAS Whey Protein was the best. I was wrong. Optimum Nutrition makes without a doubt the best protein on the market. The taste is very mild and if you mix it with water it's not very thick. Some may or may not like that, but for me it's perfect. This protein has excellent reviews on many forums and those are well deserved. If you're looking for something that tastes and works great look no further, plus it's a steal at this price. Don't waste your money with other overpriced proteins that don't even work or mix as well.

I feel like protein powders meet a need, but for me personally-none of them taste good!  This one is the one I can get down the best.  As for consistency and texture it is fine.  It is more the fake tastes they try to add to them that always bother me.  It is a very strong/bold cookies and cream flavor.

I started off with the Strawberry flavor which was just OK for me. I just got the cookies and cream flavor and it's really good. I was hesitate to get this flavor because of all the negative reviews on it. To me, it tastes like an iced coffee. I really don't taste cookies and cream. Nonetheless in my opinion it's better than the strawberry flavor.

Great protein.I have seen some solid gains while using it, however, it is a few dollars more than the 'generic' brands of protein you can get from say Walmart. If I had more money I would stick to this, however, I suppose I will just switch back and forth between the inexpensive stuff and this brand.

Whether it's any better in terms of results compared to other protein is something I would never be able to discern. The stuff tastes absolutely delicious and to be frank, it's almost a bit too rich, but it mixes nicely and whether it's with water or milk it's a darn good drink. I've decided to try another ON flavor for my newest protein (double rich chocolate) which is a bit more subdued but still pretty good. I dig the products though and will buy it again when I'm low on protein.

Okay so all the hate I saw in the reviews scared me but it wasn’t bad at all.So I’ve been working out lately (actually started working out in like March so I bought my first bag around that time) and I wanted some protein powder to help with the healing and building of muscles and this is the brand I chose. I did all sorts of calculations to make sure I used the right amount of powder for my weight with the inclusion of aiming to build muscles as stated by the DRI (Dietary Reference Intake) and to stay within my calorie limit intake.(SCOOP aka MEASURING CUP: ) Also you don’t need a scoop if you already have measuring cups. Just Google “grams to cups” and then it gives you measurement conversions for cups, grams, and ounces. And if you can’t even figure out which measuring cup you need with it literally spelled out for you like that then you must not have graduated high school or even made it pass middle school bro 😭💀💀(TASTE: ) At first I just used water and the powder but I legit threw up in my mouth cause it tasted like baby formula lol, buuuuut later I had the thought to just turn it into a smoothie!! So now I use 1c of frozen strawberries (45cal), 1/2 banana (53cal), 1c hemp milk (100cal) or 2c for (200cal), 1 or 2 ice cubes, and sometimes I add some chia seeds or a fiber one bar. And I have to say I can’t even taste the powder anymore!! I use one of those ninja single serve blenders to blend all that stuff together and drink one in the morning to start my day and then one right after I finish working out in the evenings. I haven’t had it clump on me so far and I’m on my FOURTH bag already.Though if your going to make a smoothie out of it don’t put the powder in there first cause it can get stuck at the bottom if you put the liquids on top of it. Instead put in only half of your liquids first (your preference of milks or juices), then your solids (your preference of veggies, fruits, or nuts), then your protein powder and lastly the other half of your liquids. Putting in the liquids like that helps the powder spread around evenly in the blender and decreases the chances of it clumping or getting stuck on the sides of the bottle. This is from experience of putting my powder at the bottom with all the liquids on top 😬😭😭 I had to scrape the powder off cause I was too stupid to even remember simple science and common sense like that 😭💀(BAG: ) Yeah the zipper doesn’t work but have any of you ever heard of folding it and then putting a clip on it?!? To ya’know, keep it closed? Or even putting it in another bag or container, lol.(PACKAGING: ) Also haven’t had a problem once with shipping and/or packaging. Sometimes I order a bunch of stuff at once and then the powder comes in a plastic bag inside a cardboard box with the rest of my items and if it’s my only order then it’s just in a plastic shipping bag and the delivery guy just leaves it on my bench next to the door. Haven’t had the bag come opened or torn in anyways and remember this is my FOURTH time ordering.(VALUE FOR MONEY: ) My mother likes to buy already pre-made protein shakes and it’s like 10 for 18$ which is just ridiculous in my opinion. This bag here gives you like 30 servings for 30$ which is a wonderful deal compared to getting pre-made shakes. In order for my mother to reach 30 shakes that’s like 50$ for 30 shakes, smh (smh means “shaking my head”).(SMELL: ) The powder doesn’t really have a strong order to it, but it does smell a little like baby formula. It’s not an overwhelming smell, and it doesn’t smell really foul or like chemicals. It just reminds me of the baby my grandma babysits, lol. On rating the smell on how bad it is from ‘0 - no smell at all’ to ‘10 - foulest most putrid scent on the planet’ I give it a 2 or 2.5 because it really has like NO SMELL. The reason I was even looking for a smell in the first place was because people were like “it smells like chemicals” and “it gives off a VERY strong odor that just puts me off.” Nah fam, it’s not even that strong, you might just have a very sensitive nose or something. (Though it does taste like baby formula a bit too so def use a smoothie recipe and mix in the powder into that.) (def means ‘definitely’)(REPUTABLE SOURCE?: ) Though this is what finally sold me!!! The fact that in their info they put that they use third-party testing to demonstrate their products’ safety!! That is basically a guarantee that they are a reputable protein powder brand. I read “healthline” and in their article about protein powders they said,“Be sure to buy powders that have been through third-party testing — they will say this on the label.” Though idk if they meant their nutrition label, on the bag label, or just their general label. (‘General label’ as in the label that defines their company or the summary labels they put up on their website.) I found their label in their information they put. Idk if everyone else reads that stuff but I do, lol.Anyway this brand is definitely a 4.4 out of 5 in my personal opinion! Will definitely continue to buy this!

I really like that this Protien doesn't have some silly flavor like cookies or desserts. I personally don't like the sweet flavors.I mixed it with my regular unsweetened cashew and almond milk and it was amazing. It tasted somewhat like regular milk or close to it.The bag is whatever so I dumped it into an old protein tub and taped the nutritional facts from the bag into the tub. (Prefect solution).I tried this brand cause it's the most affordable, calories are lower, and 26g of Protien.The other brand I was using raised their prices so I can't afford it anymore.I hope bulk supplements keeps these prices low cause they are my new favorite and I'll keep coming back for more. (I also bought the creatine and it's also a great price).

The protein powder is excellent but the packaging could be improved that’s why I gave it 4 stars.  I don’t understand why because the creatine in buy the bags always close properly but with every bag of protein the bag will not close properly and I have to fold over the top and put a clip on it to help keep the powder fresh.  Otherwise, their protein powder is to shelf stuff and I will continue to purchase it.

The product itself is great.  The problem is the bags.  All of their product comes in the same type of ""resealable"" bag.  The zip lock portion of the bags never work.  Just transfer the contents into a container.  Make better bags and it'll be 5 stars.

I've used this protein consistently for months. The best thing about it is that it practically has no flavor. So combining it with other ingredients is perfect.Don't be a heathen and drink it with water or by itself. Get a nutribullet like a regular person and make a proper shake. Banana, milk, yogurt etc.

This is the 3rd unflavored whey isolate I’ve tried. It’s the best value when it comes to price per serving, however, it doesn’t mix well. Even in a shaker bottle, it’s still clumpy. Out of the 3 I’ve tried, isopure, this and Nowsports, the nowsports is by far the best one.

I'm glad I found this whey.  It has completely changed the way I look at...whey.  I got it today and have had several servings already, as today's workout was quite intense and I didn't eat a whole lot.  To give some history on me, I've been lifting weights for a little under three years now, and I've always gone with the commercial whey powders you find in the supermarket or at supplement stores.  No problems gaining muscle, I've been able to blow up big time by force feeding myself protein of all kinds and working very hard.  I've come to realize that in order to get the most out of your lifts, protein powder is an easy way to work towards that, and becomes a mainstay for any avid builder.  To put it simply, this is all anyone should want in a whey protein powder, because it doesn't have anything else in it.  For every 122 calories, you get 27g protein, which is a great ratio.  And for $25 (the 1kg option), you get 50 servings, which is 50x27=1350g of protein.  That's 54g of protein per $1 spent(!!).  That's a practically unheard of value when you compare it to other whey supplements out there.  The last whey I was using regularly, also in $25 amounts (I won't mention the name), which I thought was actually a pretty good deal, comparatively only yielded just under 22g per $1.  And on top of that, it is higher in calories and requires way more powder to deliver the same amount of protein.  Those extra calories come from all kinds of additives that are designed to make the commercial whey powders taste good...usually chocolate or vanilla, which I was never crazy about, regardless of the brand.  And on top of that, those other whey protein powders are not especially easy to dissolve into liquids, yogurts, or whatever you're trying to use as the vessel for your whey.  I'd always get nice big powdery clumps even after stirring the heck out of those powders.  Sure those results weren't ideal, but I figured that was the way whey had to be.  Wrong!This BulkSupplements whey is completely different.  First is the taste.  It isn't supposed to taste like anything, and it doesn't especially.  To me it tastes sort of like milk or something, I actually like the flavor.  It's subtle and is not at all sweet or sickening like those other much more artificial and commercial whey options.  And secondly, it's white, fluffy, and filled with protein and only protein.  That means it dissolves very easily, and gives a great protein to powder ratio.  So you won't be dealing with some thick, over-filling, clumpy protein shake that forces you to have some weird artificially flavored and sweetened desert drink any time you want your whey.  To me this BulkSupplements whey is a great option and indeed probably the absolute best option for people who understand that to build muscle, you need lots of protein...and that commercial whey powders are overpriced and loaded with unappetizing and unnecessary extras.  Hey, if you are totally into the taste and price of those name-brand gimmick supplements, avoid this great whey powder.  But if you're like me, you'll love this stuff, especially because you can actually get it delivered same-day with something like $35 spent.  To me this is something to be really excited about that will make a big, positive change in how I get my much-needed protein!

It is a very soluble powder with no sweeteners or additives.  If you add it to a cup of water you wont even notice a difference in viscosity or even that it is there...until you drink it.  Can't really taste it but it has what you need and loaded with Branch Chain Amino Acids, Protein, the absolute lowest in calories of any product for the protein on the market.  You can't beat it because I tried after spending lots of money and many thousands of hours of searching.I'm 44 years old.  I started lifting weights a year ago, but because of my age and lack of muscle getting started was HARD  I was unable to go to the gym more than a couple times a week until I ordered this whey protein isolate and 4 other supplements from ""BulkSupplements"".  Everything ordered has been the absolute most pure with no fillers, its all powder and very mixable and the icing on the cake is their American made products are the cheapest.So...if I make a shake consisting of:  Whey Protein Isolate, Creatine, BCAA, L Glutamine, Beta Alanine, drink it durring workout plus some latter in the day, I can work out every day, not get tired, and NEVER get sore muscles.  It makes me feel like im on steroids while I'm working out and I feel like my testosterone levels have gone through the roof.I didn't feel like I could review this product without a mention of the others I ordered from this company having such amazing results.  I took a very scientific approach to my health transformation and im telling you my formula worked for me and I changed my life...and I did it very fast lol.Lost 60 pounds in four months while unemployed because I wanted to be able to compete with younger ragamuffins in the labor-force.  Watch my video if you want.  It just shows me getting skinny and unpacking the supplements from BulkSuppliments.Bottom line, yes this is the best whey protein ""isolate"" and also the cheapest.  Made in Wisconsin USA.  Oh I mixed it up with powdered milk too and that also worked well for me since I already purchased other supplements.  It made it last longer.This is the more expensive of the supplements I listed but the others are measured by half teaspoon and so on so they will last a very long time if used as directed.Every time I drink one of my shakes with these supplements then work out, I feel like I could kill a whole bunch of people with my bare hands.  It's not like that if I just eat a good diet.  These supplements are the real deal.  Never get tired, never get sore.One more thing, do you have a job where you feel like you are going to fall asleep while working and it is unbearable?  Drink the recovery shake thing with the supliments I outlined here and you'll feel like you just woke up.

Like many others, I started a new diet in the new year, and I needed a good quality whey protein powder to make my daily shake. I knew I wanted something clean with no added garbage ingredients and no sweeteners (natural or artificial). I spent an hour or so looking at the options on Amazon and the websites of local stores, reading reviews and learning about emulsifiers. I decided on the Bulk Supplements whey protein powder because of the price and good reviews. I have never used plain whey protein powder before, and I was a little worried about the taste (if you have ever tried plain rice protein powder before, you would understand my qualms). I mixed one serving (30 grams) of this with unsweetened vanilla almond milk in a blender bottle, and I was very pleasantly surprised! It's creamier than other whey protein powders I've tried, and I honestly think it tastes better than many of the vanilla flavored powders out there. I had Designer Whey French Vanilla yesterday and had to choke it down because it tastes so fake, but this powder just tastes clean and creamy, even with thin, watery almond milk. Now, an hour later, I can say I never noticed any aftertaste, either. This is not the case with Designer Whey, which is also full of garbage ingredients. And speaking of ingredients, I read quite a bit about soy lecithin, an emulsifier and the only other ingredient in this product, while researching protein powders. While some people may not want to consume it because of concerns with GMO crops, soy/estrogen issues, or soy allergies, I read enough to assuage any concerns I had over using a product every day that contains a small amount of soy lecithin. Here's one article I read on it that others may find informative: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amanda-greene/soy-lecithin-why-is-it-in_b_2891780.htmlThe only negatives I have on this are related to the packaging. I didn't expect anything fancy (especially for the price), but I could not get the package to reseal. I plan to put it into a glass container anyway to store it on my counter more attractively, so I'm not taking any stars off for it, but it could be an annoyance for folks who are just going to use it out of the package. I ended up putting a piece of press & seal over the top of it this morning and will transfer it to another container after work. The second potential negative is that there's no scoop in the package (at least not that I've found yet - sometimes they are like the hidden prizes in cereal boxes that you have to use half of the product first to discover). The standard protein powder serving is 30 grams, though, so you can use a scoop from another protein powder product if you have one, which I happened to have.

You're going to need it. The Product is great. Package $ucks. I am meticulous in opening these resealable zip bags and yet most don't open well.The 2lb bag has a THIN single zip (smaller than a sandwich bag) that peels off instead of unzipping. This happened the first time and on this 2nd bag. Seriously $.03 could make it a better experience. For now, expect to transfer it to another container. Open it over a sink because the powder goes up inside the tear off for the zipper. Try to shake it back down and open carefully.I researched the price/same protein serving of other brands and found my standard go-to 'Cabot whey' actually costs more and it's not even isolate. This is a deal.I took off one star for the package I hate. At least you can recycle a plastic jug. This is only one of four products I use from BULK. Good stuff...poor packages.

July 2019 (Revised Review):So, I have enjoyed this powder for the first three orders and felt it deserved 5-stars.  In the past, I have tried flavored whey powders, but always felt the taste was just 'tolerable' and never really enjoyed drinking them.  This unflavored powder actually taste good to me, when mixed with whole milk, and I genuinely looked for ward to drinking it after my workout.Fast forward to my fourth order....Something changed in the manufacturing and the newest bag left an awful sour aftertaste.  It tasted like drinking bad milk... yuck!  I contacted the company, and went back and forth a bit (with what seemed to be a few different people), but I didn't feel any of them were sympathetic to my complaint.  They said nothing was changed in the process and  that I could send the remainder of the bag to a test facility for analysis.  If it came back as bad, they would refund my purchase.  I was okay with this, up until the part where I was responsible for the shipping charges for sending the product.  I felt they should have immediately sent a replacement and paid for the item to be shipped to the testing facility.Alas, I really needed a replacement, so I went ahead and ordered another bag myself, hoping that I would get a batch of the original formula.  Nope!  What I got was slightly more tolerable, but still had a sour aftertaste.Neither of these batches caused me any side effects, so I continued to use them.  I found that if I don't breathe through my nose while drinking, I don't taste the sourness.  I can then eat a couple spoonfuls of peanut butter immediately after drinking, and it covers the sour taste.  This is now my new routine.I plan on finishing off the rest of this product, but will have to find a different brand from now on, which is unfortunate because the price is good and the original formula was actually a good taste for me.  I'm really surprised that not many other reviews reflect the change in taste that I have experienced.  It makes me somewhat skeptical as to the validity of them all._________________________________________________________January 2019 (Original Review):Headline:  Definite Increase in Muscle Mass with Cardio (Rowing) RoutineMy workout routine (for well over a year now) consists of 40-minutes on a rowing machine everyday before work (5-days each week).  I started using this supplement (along with the creatine powder) about three months ago (October), and can already see a quick increase of the muscle mass in my arms.  My wife has noticed, and even my Mother-in-Law made a comment about my arms, when she was visiting this past Christmas.I'm not sure if the results are more from the protein powder or the creatine (or more likely, the combination of both), but whatever it is, it certainly works!.  I have already been through one full-sized bag and am now on my second order.  It seems to be a pretty good bang for the buck.

I love this product, I'm on myy second bag. It has low sugar, high protein, has no visible flavor (quite palatable as is) but I can add flavoring if I so choose (e.g., orange juice, cocoa, vanilla).  It makes me feel awesome in a healthy way and when I ran out for 2 days, I could visibly feel why - no protein drink that day! I've tried MANY others - this is the real deal. Also has amino acids very much need; no need to take pills. Love the low sugar, and the trace amount of soy lecithin is an emulsifier (keeps product from sticking together I think). MUCH less than soy-based protein powders, which are no good for anyone, let alone me (thyroid issues). I wanted to leave feedback for this product prior to being offered a free sample of another one Bulk Supplements' products, but that was just an added bonus. I selected the smallest size of Organic Whey Protein powder (which I don't even now see on Amazon).  That product has a higher level of sugar (1 gram, no good for me) but NO SOY. It has a visibly sweet taste, actually quite good. And it's organic, which I liked, but I can't have high levels of sugar nor do I like sweet drinks. My health has improved daily after adding the Whey Protein Powder Isolate to my every day regimen, I've lost a bit of weight, my blood work is improved, and I have much more natural energy and far fewer cravings for ""bad foods."" As if that's not enough great reasons to buy it, when you buy these larger bags (they stay fresh if get the ziploc closed for sure), they last longer, you don't run out as quickly as the canisters of protein powder, and it's cheaper in the long run!!! Hint: save one of those empty canisters of other products, clean it out, then store your Bulk Supplement in it for daily use, then refill it when it gets empty. These equates to less daily struggles to ensure the bag is indeed closed. I shared this product info with my older brother who has been taking a different brand of protein powder for years, then that manufacturer changed it so that he can no longer tolerate the horrible taste --this is a COMMON complaints from many protein powder drinkers.  THIS PRODUCT tastes great as is, but I add 1-2 ounces of orange juice, along with daily greens and psyllium husk, and it tastes even better. My brother just informed me that he switched to this Bulk Supplements product and LOVES the taste, as is, and also sometimes adds vanilla extract (his favorite flavor). Buy it; it's great tasting and great for your body and health.

I'd like to preface this review by stating that about a week after receiving this, my first BulkSupplements purchase, the company reached out to me and offered me a ""free trial"" of another of their products, under the promise that I would write a review about it and this purchase.If that alone isn't a reason to buy one of these products (and from other reviews it seems that getting this free stuff is pretty common-place with this company), there are a ton of other reasons why you should. First off, the gorilla in the room: price. I'm new to the ""bodybuilding"" world of supplements and buckets of powder and all the other stuff, but I'm a big researcher. For a 90% whey isolate, I'm not even sure where I'd begin looking for a better value, with a lot of servings, for a lower price.Furthermore, while this product is pretty much tasteless (not an issue for me, although I know that's a key point for some other people), it completely dissolves instantly in whatever you put it in. This is important for me because I combine something like this with ON's Mass Gainer, and the last thing I need is more clumpy powder on top of the fist-sized half serving that goes in my blender.There are two reasons this product didn't get five stars: first, there is no measuring scoop (at least that I've found). I'm a college kid, and getting measuring cups wasn't high on my list of things I needed for my kitchen, and I threw out the measuring cups from other protein buckets. This has left me with the aforementioned fist-sized scoop for my Mass Gainer. Everyone likes to know that they're actually getting the protein they think they are, so I'm not sure why there is no scoop. The second thing is that the ziplock on this bag is impossible to actually close. Just awful.However, the benefits of this product -- easy mix-ability, incredible price, 90% protein per gram, the fact that this company will almost certainly reach out to you and offer you free stuff -- easily outweighs the negatives -- no scoop, a finicky ziplock, and lack of taste (although you can't really complain about that when there are only two ingredients that go into this, which is what you want from an isolate).Do yourself a favor and try this stuff out. Fantastic use of 25 bucks.

I highly recommend this whey powder as an option to increase protein content of most foods and  liquids. I often encounter people who have a need for a flavorless (nearly) product.  It dissolves better in warm /hot liquid (soup, hot cocoa, coffee, etc).  It can be added to hot/warm water and cooled.  I've used this  to make powdered milk, water down juices, and added flavored water enhancers such as MIO Sport which also contains electrolytes.  It's wonderful in creamy/saucy foods such as whipped/mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and Alfredo and tomato sauce  I've added it to baking mixes such as cookie dough, cake batter, & pancakes.  I have not tried it with bread mixes or anything that rises.  I encourage you to experiment in small batches.  I have made homemade dip using greek yogurt, chicken or beef bullion, onion flakes, bulk whey powder, and spices. I like using Tajin', Frank's Red Hot,  and various Mrs. Dash flavors.  I also add it to flavored yogurt and used it in frozen yogurt cream pie, as a fruit dip, or to increase protein content of lower protein (not Greek) yogurt!  Finally, it's an excellent smoothie addition!

What can I say... it's clean whey!I haven't purchased whey protein online in quite a while, being that I'm always the type that would prefer to hold and lift and inspect a product as much as I can. Unfortunately, you can't always find the best deals on a quality product within the reaches of a brick and mortar store.Lets reflect on the pros.-Price : On point. Seriously. You can't really find much of a better deal on 2.2lbs of protein that isn't practically a powdered milkshake.- Ingredients : Whey Protein Isolate 90%. Check. Oh and there is also soy lecthin used as an emulsifier. Yeah, its not free of soy but its free of sugar (the big one for me), yeast, gluten and corn.-Grams of protein : So each serving size is 30 grams. With every serving, there is 27 grams. Yep. That's what sold me as well. 27 out of 30 is all I want. I don't want the sugar or the ""trick your brain"" fake flavorings.-Taste : Its what you expect plain ass whey protein to taste! Its a fine flavor to me but also keep in mind I'm a person who have no troubles mixing anything with water and drinking it up like it is a sugary milkshake. Other than water I've tried mixed into pineapple juice, the whey is barely noticeable to the disconcerting tongue.Cons- Well, this should be quite short - and it is. My only gripe is the resealable lock for the bag doesn't feel as secure as I would like it. I feel that it pulls apart a bit too easy. I'm considering dumping it into a decent size screwtop jar. While dumping it, I hope a mini scooper (that doesn't seem to come with this) falls out.In conclusion, all in all its exactly what I asked for and is exactly what I'm looking for. The product is plain ass whey isolate without any crappy filler. Its at a great price. It shipped fast. The packaging is solid (minus the not as secure as I would like resealable zip top). I certainly would be willing to try out more of their products for sure.

My original review of Whey Isolate from Bulk Supps praised the product for its high quality and consistency. I regret to say that is no longer the case. I have been buying the same Whey Isolate powder from Bulk Supps going on 2 years now, so I am very familiar with the product. Unfortunately my most recent order from 12/2016 completely changed my view of the company.I noticed almost immediately after I opened the new pouch that something was ""off"". Their normal whey powder is very fluffy and white, and this wasn't the same powder. The color was closer to a beige color and the powder was heavier and more coarse. I didn't really think much of this fact until I began actually trying to mix it with water in a glass. It took forever to dissolve, and left nasty little chunks of powder no matter how much I sitrred. The liquid was a strange sort of goopy vomit color which I didnt find the least bit appealing.When I tried drinking the protein I was taken back by the ghastly, horrible flavor. Now I was sure this wasn't the same powder, because the product I was used to never tasted this bad. I begrudgingly finished the glass and 30 minutes later I had some of the worst upset stomach of my life. This really pissed me off because the whole reason i switched to Bulk Supplements in the first place was because their powder gave me none of these issues.I used to drink cheap Wal Mart protein powders before I switched to Bulk Supplements and this new powder was consistent with the low quality and flavor I remembered from the Wal Mart brands. It became increasingly clear that this ""batch"" wasn't from their usual supplier, and not the stuff I was used to paying for. They substituted with a different, cheaper powder for whatever reason.I promptly sent out an e-mail to Bulk Supplements explaining my issue along with the batch and lot number of my pouch of protein. Within a day I got a response from their associate Amy. She explained that she looked up the batch number and that yes, they did in fact switch suppliers during that particular time and that they have switched back to the correct supplier. That was it. No apology, no attempt to rectify the matter by sending me out the right product, no offer of a refund or anything. She basically shooed me away to Amazon customer service and that was about it.Lets face it guys; Bulk Supplements charges a high premium for their products, but we as the customer are OK with paying it because they (used to) have a high standard of quality and consitency. I think its very dishonest to temporarily switch to this clearly inferior product without #1 informing your customers and #2 continuing to charge the premium price for the bad product.I replied to Amy, explaining that this doesnt solve my situation at all, and that I was still stuck sitting here with the crappy product which I didnt want be stuck with for the next few weeks. I explained to her that the reasonable solution was to send me the correct powder, and that I could ship them back the ""fake"" powder they orignally sent me.At this point Amy said this wasn't going to be possible, and that the fake powder was all they hadin stock. Its important to note that this completely contradicts her earlier statement about switching back to the original supplier. I pointed this out and she basically switched to generic customer service responses from that point on.I really liked this company. I recommended them to all my friends and family. I use about seven other products that they produce, but the way they handled this situation disappointed and disgusted me. I have spent well into the thousands on their products and they couldnt handle an issue as basic as this. Also, their dishonestly about their product consistency I found very unbecoming in regards to the company I was used to doing business with.

Very clean product that really has no flavor at all. You can mix this with water and still pretty much not taste anything. The actual protein in this product is a huge reason to purchase this. If you are wondering how to find out the actual protein in your powder then use this calculation :Yield refers to the percentage of protein per serving that is obtained. Mathematically it appears as follows:(Grams Protein Per Serving x 100) / Serving Size In GramsFor example, say we had a protein powder that had a serving size of 100 grams total mass. Lets also assume that in that 100gm serving size 50gms was protein. This would be a yield of 50%. Therefore, when purchasing the product, you would be paying for 50% non-protein! Not a good deal. If you want protein you should pay for protein, not non-protein [some of which will be filler].With a product like Optimum Nutrition's 100% Whey, for example, observe the calculation:(22 Grams Protein Per Serving X 100) / 29.4 Grams Serving Size = 74.8%The only two drawbacks I could mention regarding this:1.It does not mix well in a shaker cup with juice, milk or any other supplements it seems. It seemed to clump a little when I did this. The clumps are not a major deal but it could deter some from using this again.2. It seems to have a froth or foam after shaking this up in the shaker unlike many protein powders I have used before. There may be something they put in the others as an additive to keep this from happening.I think this is perfect for blending with a smoothie or just with plain water right after a workout. I personally will order this again, but will not have this as my only protein powder due to the bad mixability with juice or other products.

UPDATE!!!I have been using this Protein powder for a few years now.  I won't purchase anything else.  I have told many people about this protein supplement and they all love it as well.  I am not a breakfast person; so I add a scoop of this powder to my morning coffee and take off for the day.  It dissolves quickly in anything I add it to without giving it a gritty or nasty taste.  I literally have tried dozens of different protein supplements and this is the only one I will continue to purchase.OMG!  This stuff is amazing!  I have finally found a protein supplement that mixes with anything, doesn't taste horrible and stays down!  I have tried dozen of protein supplements in the past 6 months with horrible results and I've spent a small fortune.  I literally stumbled upon this Bulk Supplements CLEAN Whey Protein powder on Amazon and it had great reviews;so I figured I would try it.  I have mixed this with orange juice, V-8 juice, chicken broth and cream of mushroom soup.  You can't tell it is in there except for a slight difference in texture.  I am the horror story poster child for Bariatric surgery.  I went in for a gastric sleeve in September.  Two weeks after the surgery, I developed a leak in the pouch.  Another surgery to repair the leak was done in October which did not work; so I ended up with a NG tube to keep the stomach emptied and a PICC line for TPN.  Then I developed an infection from the PICC line.  The third surgery was November.  It was the ruen-Y bypass because the leak never healed.  I haven't been able to eat any type of protein or take protein supplements to obtain more than 20 G at any given day.  Most days it was closer to 0 Grams.  Bulk Supplements CLEAN Whey Protein powder may have just saved me!

Why you'll love it:My first time ordering from BulkSupplements. I didn't do a ton of research beforehand, but have a few friends who do competitive bodybuilding and say that the brand is very legitimate.I was a little worried about nitrogen spiking or amino spiking as some supplement brands have recently come under fire for cheating tests and misleading the true protein content. From my understanding, ingredients like creatine, taurine, and glycine are added to boost the test results and give higher than labeled protein totals. Looking over the ingredients, BulkSupplements uses just whey protein isolate and soy lecithin (for an emulsifier). I looked over the amino acid profile and see that glycine is listed, but from my understanding there are trace amounts of this that occur naturally in whey protein and it is not listed as an added ingredient in the list.Taste profile:I did this plain in room temperature water and was easily able to down it. I've had MusclePharm and it comes across as too sweet. I can see myself maybe adding a little cocoa or powdered peanut butter at times, but this tasted no different from skim milk. I even added a little glutamine and it was terrific straight out of the bag.I've yet to use this long enough to see any results, but there have been plenty of pictures on here of people who have had success building lean muscle mass.Why you won't love it:BulkSupplements obviously saves money from using bags and I firmly understand that they are better for the environment (both in logistically and recycling). Unfortunately, the quality of zipper that is used is rather terrible. It's very hard to seal at times (especially if there happens to be some powder stuck in the track) and I am a bit worried for keeping this dry. Thankfully it doesn't get too humid in Michigan, but those in more temperate climates may want to invest in a better storage system (or perhaps toss some silica gel packets in).

I have been searching for a protein that is basic, with minimal or no fillers and unnecessary extras ingredients. I wanted something I could easily add to meals without having the taste of a protein shake be too obvious. I make a lot of recipes with my proteins and I wanted something that could be flexible with multiple different flavors.With all that said, this protein is exactly what I have been looking for! It is the smoothest protein I have ever had, with not a single clump, even when simply stirred with a spoon. It has a very slight protein flavor, as expected- but hardly noticed when mixed with milk or put into my recipes.Alongside having a healthier, minimalist protein, I have noticed I do not get nauseous or have as much reflux like I do when I typically drink other protein powder shakes. I am picky about protein powders because of this and do not tolerate several brands. Optimum nutrition has been my favorite for almost two years, but Bulk supplements may be replacing them. I also looked into Naked Whey due to their minimalist ingredients on the unflavored, but Bulk Supplements is much cheaper currently.Upon arrival, mine was still sealed in its container with no powder outside the bag, as other reviews have noted. It was literally packed full and so I simply snipped the top corner off and emptied the contents into an air-sealed container. It does not come with a scoop, which could be nice. However, I own a food scale which measures in grams and have been able to accurately measure each serving to fit my needs.If you are using a scale and only have ounces available, the 30 gram serving is equivalent to 1.05 ounces (I measured several times to double check since I typically use ounces for my measurement on other foods). I hope y'all find this review helpful! I'll update this review later if I notice any issues or change my opinion on the protein after long term use.

After reading some recent reviews I thought I would update my old one. I'm up to at least one and as many as three 45 gram servings of this a day while cutting weight. Mixed with water it doesn't taste great. So what? If you can't eat anything that doesn't taste like candy or birthday cake, that's why you're fat. The packaging is minimal and I like that. Less waste. There is no scoop to throw away. I weigh it out. Digital scales are cheap anymore. I've never noticed any inconsistency or had any problem with delivery. Here's my earlier review which I think is probably from early 2018:It is what it says it is. No flavorings. No sweeteners. It claims 27 grams of protein in a 30 gram serving. I had just finished a pack of their regular powder when I ordered this. The weird, kind of cheesy flavor of that stuff had kind of grown on me. I had been mixing it into my plain oatmeal at breakfast. I'm not one for sweets, especially in the morning. This stuff is pretty much flavorless, though it does have a somewhat vague odor kind of like an old undershirt(?) The texture is a little gritty compared to the other, and doesn't mix quite as well. Two ingredients: isolated whey protein and a little bit of an emulsifier. For when you're not screwing around.Update: I'm now on my third or fourth kilo bag of this stuff. I've been training strongman pretty heavy for the last 9 months. It's hard to get a gram of protein per pound of bodyweight especially when you're restricting calories. I couldn't do it without this stuff. I'm taking at least 30-45 grams of this a day for fast protein and another 30-45g of their casein for slow protein. I've cut 15lbs of bodyweight in about 90 days (including Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years) while still setting new PRs on strict press, bench and atlas stones. Five stars.

The product came shipped as described.  This is my first order from BulkSupplements.  I have only recently started researching bulk products.  I am a 52 year old male that has been active and fit most of my life.  I started taking supplements back in the mid 70's and have tried COUNTLESS products and spent 10's of thousands of dollars over the years.  Having recently gotten very tired of all the marketing hype that is associated with fitness products I started researching bulk, clean and verified for purity products.This protein is very clean, it mixes easily with water or juice or milk or any combination.  It is low in calories, low in fat, low cholesterol.  The taste is almost non-existent and what there is certainly isn't bad.  When I mix it with OJ I almost can't tell it is there.  It is not a blend of proteins, just whey isolate.I have consumed several servings on a regular schedule since it arrival and have had zero GI issues, which for those of you who have had the misfortune of other products that do, I'm sure the importance of that is of great value.My decision to switch to a bulk came from reading the label on my last 5lb jug of ""new and improved taste"" protein.  Trying to eat clean and organic as much as possible I had to ask my self why I was paying premium dollars for a protein that was so full of chemicals???  If I can't pronounce it, why is it in my protein?Additionally I like that all info is clearly displayed, lot number, manufacture date, expiration date etc… simple label, clear and free of useless graphic design.  No false claims of superiority, just clean protein.I have two other BulkSupplements products that I will be reviewing as well.Regards,Edward

I don't eat meat, so I am always looking for a way to get more protein into my diet.  I usually rely on the typical protein powders, though I am getting really sick of vanilla, chocolate and bad imitaition fruit flavors.  So I decided to try this.  So far, it isn't bad, but it isn't great.  Some of this maybe user error, as I am still adjusting the proportions.  The first day, I made a fruit smoothie, and added what would be comparable to the 20g of protein in my usual shake.  Well, it was too much, very thick, with the chalky taste familiar to most.  I ended up adding things to make it more drinkable.  The next day, I added much less powder, and it was better... but I think I may need to add a bit of sweetener now (I use fresh fruit, water, ice and protein powder in my smoothie) to now mask the aftertaste.  Another day I added it to a store bought smoothie mix, and you could definately tell powder was added, unIike in a smoothie shop where its undetectible.  have not yet tried it in recipies, which was one of the reasons I bought this, unflavored, was to add when cooking to up protein levels.  So I will continue to work on finding better ways to use this.  The powder itself seems legit, as I do a protein shake for breakfast on days I cannot get a lunch, and it kept my appetite in check like usual.  I hope to continue to learn so I can use it more and like it better.

UPDATE: 5/2018I've stopped buying protein supplements altogether.  I have discovered that it is more beneficial (and enjoyable) to just eat eggs.  Each egg has about 6g of protein.  Therefore, I consume 3 eggs to get 18g of protein blending them with frozen pineapple or frozen berries or combination thereof. That's all I need. It's a recovery drink AND a protein drink that contains many natural vitamins and minerals as well. No food coloring, no emulsifiers, and no preservatives. It's all natural.  Some people think that eggs have too much cholesterol but the truth is, they have the good type of cholesterol that your body uses, not the bad kind that gets stuck in your arteries.  Anyway, I eat tons of oatmeal every day which protects against absorption of the bad type of cholesterol.  I buy a carton of 18 eggs for $2.79.  That yields 6 servings of protein drinks. Bulk Supplements Isolate Protein powder package yields 33 servings for $26.  I can get 36 servings buying eggs for $16.75.  I save $10, get more servings, get a mega dose of vitamins and minerals, and still get an actual usable dose of protein.  Are you really getting 30g of protein in each serving of Bulk Supplements?  Even if you are, will your body really absorb all 30g of it after your work out? Unlikely on both fronts.  I've definitely seen an increase in my muscle mass vs. when I was using Bulk Supplements.  My recommendation is to go all natural in your diet and don't fall victim of the supplement industry's marketing.  You can definitely build muscle and burn fat without it.UPDATE:  2 months of useI've been taking this protein mostly as a post-workout (weight lifting) drink. I work out pretty much every day and have taken this supplement accordingly.  In a nutshell, this product hasn't made me sick or given me any side effects. That's the good news.  The bad news is that I haven't seen any noticeable improvements in my muscle mass even though my weight lifting exercises have been stepped up appropriately for building mass.  My diet has also been modified to accommodate the increase in workout intensity so I should have seen some kind of dramatic improvement akin to when I used other more recognizable brands such as Muscle Milk (I know it's terrible stuff but it did add bulk).At this point, I've got one serving left in my 2nd bag (I purchased two).  I'm considering purchasing 1 more bag to give this product one more month to show me something.  I want to believe this product works & is exactly what it says it is.  The product didn't come with a scooper and I don't have an exact table spoon measure so I've been using a scoop cup from a previous protein brand.  Judging from my research on Google, it seems that a scoop typically holds 30grams of protein powder.  But this doesn't mean that the amount of actual protein in that scoop equates to 30 grams or even 27 grams as the label on the bag indicates is in a single serving.  I found a site that said 1 scoop of whey isolate contains about 17grams of actual protein.  So if I go by that, I'll have to increase the amount I put in my drink to 1 1/4 or 1 1/2 scoop of the Bulk Supplements whey protein isolate in order to get approximately 30 grams of actual protein.Alright, I have decided to order one more bag and increase the amount of powder I put into my drinks.  I will update this review a 3rd time when I've completely run out of the product.  In the meantime I've docking this product 1 star and bringing it down to 3 stars.....for now.  Stay tuned for my next update.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW (JULY 15, 2016)I just received this product. It arrived quickly and on time. The package was as described with no damage and zip locks completely.Given that I just received this product, I can not yet say how effective it is. I can say that it mixes with water or juices very well and very quickly.  It doesn't have a taste but I can tell that I've added something to my fruit juices or water.  I use an automatic juicer to juice veges & fruits & then I mix in this whey protein powder.  I've been using it for a week.  I'm giving it 4 stars for now & will update after a month's use to determine if I'll add a 5th star or dock it some stars.  I can say right now that I don't feel bloated after taking this supplement much like I used to with other protein powders and protein drinks I'd buy from the store.

So far I've tried Bulk Supplements unflavored, unsweetened Casein, Whey Isolate and Egg White. I always use unflavored/unsweetened protein powders in my fruit smoothie recipes because I get plenty of flavor and sweetness from ingredients other than the protein powders, and the minimalist protein powder ingredients allow me to avoid excess sugar. In addition, I love that the Bulk Supplements Whey Isolate powder does not add any off flavors. Its milk-like scent is not apparent once blended into a smoothie, and it enhances the richness of the dairy I use (usually plain yogurt or kefir) which makes for a very satisfying smoothie. I use a Vitamix to blend the smoothie, so I have not noticed any chalk or grit. It does foam up when blended on highest setting. To avoid this, I blend everything but the protein powder on high setting, then add the Whey Isolate and blend a few seconds on a lower setting. With Bulk Supplements' great options in packaging sizes, I was able to try more types of protein powder without a huge investment. It turns out that Bulk Supplements Casein worked better for me than the Whey Isolate, because it held my appetite far longer. However, Whey Isolate is still a super product, and if I mix half / half with Whey Isolate and Casein, I can get the best of both fast and slow acting protein.I don't have anything too critical to say since the product is effective, the price is great and the packaging is not fussy. My only hesitation in repurchasing is that I am trying to avoid soy, and many of the Bulk Supplements products include soy lecithin. I would prefer either sunflower lecithin or none. Regardless, this is a super product for those who want control over what goes into a smoothie or other high protein snacks. My ranking of Bulk Supplements protein powders I've tried: 1-Casein, 2-Whey Isolate, 3-Egg White.

I’ve used Bulk Supplements many times before without any issue but this stuff is terrible. Save your money and put it towards a more expensive protein. The bag is a pain to close hold the time and this is unflavored but you can still very much taste some kind of twang with it(it’s always mixed in something flavored) and then the mixability itself is non existent.

If your reading this your like me, your smart and do your research before you buy maybe even pages and pages of reviews. This protein deserves a review from me as its not just another product, this is a solution.  I've been around the supplement and protein block for decades. I have my favorites and decided to give this a try because of other reviews I have read. The reviews I've read were all correct. I'll explain.Cons:Bag is hard to closeHere is a solution. After opening the bag for  the first time wipe the zip lock clean with your finger  and run a nail along the edges and with a little finesse the bag closes perfectly every time. This is the only con I have to me It’s not that big of a deal.Pros:Taste is subtle, clean and good. Tastes just like a clean protein should taste without any fillers.High protein ratio 27g protein for a 30g serving the other 3g are soy.I like that it’s made in Wisconsin.Mixes great with everything I've used so far. After a grueling workout where I’ve drained myself completely I immediately have 12oz of water and 30g of this Protein in a shaker and shake it up and down she goes and I feel pretty good after that! I have a bad stomach too and this protein has no negative effect on reflux for me.The price is right and the product is fresh and  its Amazon they will get it to you quick!This protein is in the "" Best "" category and is purchased by me many times and I have high standards and they have been met.One picture below is a scale with almost 5 full tbsp and the other is a picture of the back of the bag. Give it a go you'll love it.BulkSupplements does a great job with this protein!!!

I bought this to try because my previous protein supplement changed their formula, and I was unhappy with how they were handling it.  This one is an amazing find.  The taste is no different than the other ""flavorless"" whey protein I was using, so for that it is a win.  It dissolves easily is any food or beverage I have tried it is thus far.  The only complaint I could come up with, if I was trying hard, is that the serving size is roughly 4Tbs and that's more than I was having to use previously.  Other than that, it is perfect for me.

Whey is a component of Milk Protein, with the other being Casein Protein. Whey may be healthier than other forms of protein. The benefits of whey are due to the protein itself, while casein may be a better muscle builder.Whey protein is one of the two proteins found in milk, with the other being Casein Protein. When a coagulant (usually renin) is added to milk, the curds (casein) and whey separate. Whey protein is the water-soluble part of milk.Whey is used as a protein supplement. It is very useful for hitting targeted daily protein goals. Whey is absorbed faster than other forms of protein, which means it also increases muscle protein synthesis used to break a fasted state.Whey also delivers a large amount of the amino acid L-cysteine, which can alleviate deficiencies that occur during aging and diabetes, as well as other conditions. While whey has also been claimed to increase fat loss, this is a function of protein, rather than the whey itself. This means that the whey itself does not reduce fat, but taking in more protein often aids with fat loss efforts.Whey does not harm the liver or kidneys, but it can exacerbate pre-existing damage. People with damaged livers or kidneys should exercise caution when increasing protein intake quickly without the guidance of a doctor.If you are an athlete or highly active person attempting to lose body fat while preserving lean muscle mass, a daily intake of 1.5-2.2g/kg bodyweight (0.68-1g/lb bodyweight) is a good goal.If you are an athlete or highly active person, or you are attempting to lose body fat while preserving lean mass, then a daily intake of 1.0-1.5g/kg bodyweight (0.45-0.68g/lb bodyweight) is a good goal.If you are sedentary and not looking to change body composition, a daily target of 0.8g/kg bodyweight (0.36g/lb bodyweight) is a good goal.

I really wish I could give like, 4 and a half stars.  The protein powder is great.  That's what matters to me.  The flavor is fine.  I bought this because my vanilla protein powder was way too sweet for me.  I can use this to cut the vanilla and still get a full dose.  So I'm happy in that regard, and that's the most important thing.So the silliness: I expected a scoop and there wasn't one, but that's really on me.  The product page doesn't say there's a scoop, so it was my expectation that was off, not their performance.The resealable bag, on the other hand, is just bad.  I know my way around a cheap zipper bag, and can usually sweet-talk them into closing at least once or twice.  This beast, though, nope.  I had to put the powder in a separate container.  If it wasn't in a zip bag I wouldn't care.  But a zip bag that doesn't zip is a swing and a miss.So there we go.  Package isn't great.  There's no scoop.  Powder tastes fine, mixes fine, and generally is fine.  And that's what I really needed.

This is an absolutely outstanding value.Like other reviewers on here have noted, I've decided to get 'back to basics' when it comes to my workouts and supplements.  I've been concerned about the various additives in other Whey Protein Powder supplements I've taken, and after researching several other brands, decided to try out BulkSupplements.First off, you absolutely can't beat the price for this volume of Whey Protein.  Feel free to look at other sites/products, but if you're a trusting soul, take my word for it that this is best bang for your buck.Now, understand this this is a 'clean/pure' Whey protein powder.  There's no artificial colors, sweeteners, additives, etc.  So if you're used to a chocolate or strawberry shake for your protein shake, this is gonna be a real 'wake up' call for you.  Now, it doesn't take bad or anything like that, it just doesn't taste like much of anything.  It's very bland.  But that's just fine with me!  And considering that this looks to be an extremely pure, high quality whey protein powder - which is exactly what you want when you're training/maintaining - you don't want any of that other crappola in your body to begin with.I've also recently purchased the BulkSupplements HMB powder as well.  I've been stacking that with this Whey Protein powder.  Both blend extremely well together.  I've only been using them for ~ 2 weeks, so I'll post an update in another ~ 6 weeks or so to give additional feedback.  But thus far I think I've recovered a bit faster and gained some (modest) increases in my resistance training.So in sum, I highly recommend this Whey Protein powder, and will be a regular customer for it going forward.

I am a longtime fan of BulkSupplements. I use many of their products, and they have great customer service.I currently ran out of my regular protein shake meal replacement and was looking for a more affordable option that was low in carbs. I have to admit I was relutant to spent the money on some of the more popular brands. Flavors are a personal thing, and I have been trying various sample sizes and having to choke it down because I didn't like it.I thought I would give this a try before I would try any more brands. I really like it. I mix it with a protein powder and almond milk to use that up. It ads a vanilla flavor to the BulkSupplement Whey powder which has really no flavor.I have no complaints and plan to repurchase and/or add it to my subscribe and save. This mixes well with no lumps. It is fluffy. I have no ill side effects with this. Current serving is 30 grams for 27grams of protein. It doesn't use up my allotted carb requirements for the day either. It is what I was looking for with out the flavor.  I use my digital scale to measure it out to be sure. But I also found that an old measuring cup from a protein powder gives the correct amount. I still weigh it though.I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I was almost reluctant to try it because of it being unflavored, but the cost savings finally won out. I like the variety I can have by mixing my own flavors and not restricted to one flavor. I am a total convert now and don't need to look elsewhere.

We began working out seriously at the beginning of 2016 and found that eating relatively healthy and working out 4-6 days a week was not really making our bodies change as much as we hoped.  We then decided to include supplements into our diet and the main supplement was whey protein (the others are a multivitamin and fish oil). The first 4 or so protein powders we tried were flavored which made the switch to drinking protein shakes easier but these flavors sometimes were not very good and the powders tended to have large amounts of calories. Also, flavored protein shakes make it difficult to add ingredients like veggies since you have to take the flavor into consideration. We decided to switch to an unflavored powder and found  BulkSupplements Whey Protein Powder Isolate in Amazon. This is the second bag I've purchased and we love it.  Although unflavored it does have a very slight vanilla taste, but you do not taste it once mixed with other ingredients like greens or fruits.  It mixes very well and it is not chalky like the other brands we tried.  The 1Kg bag of Isolate is the same price as a 1 Kg tub of cheap concentrate from Walmart. Only issue is that the bag is sometimes difficult to close as the zip is not the best quality.  Not a big deal as I just roll the bag closed. This is a great choice for those that are looking to gain lean muscle while keeping both calories and money spent low!  We already have a few other BulkSupplements items in mind to purchase as they all have great reviews and I suspect we will be very happy with their quality.

As far as the description of the product and past products I have received from BS, they work as expected and the purity is as good as how my body deals with it, which is also good so far.  I have purchased many different supplements as I make my own pre workout.  So far I have created the best pre workout I have ever had, and I have about 20 years experience using supplements.  So I know the supplement I buy work as they should.  I wish I had a lab in my kitchen where I can test the purity of all these products considering the supplement world is so chaotic and dollar driven.  Like many of you, I do not trust China products or anything they lay their hands on, but you can only get so far with that.  Which leaves me only with the trust of the company's integrity.  I have to trust that they test their products, and I understand some issues may fall through the cracks and reach consumers..that's business.  But as far as a company to consistently stay on top of their products so to protect their consumers, I trust them so far.  The whey tastes clean, I'm lactose intolerant and only experience very light if any bloating and inflation when taking this product.  Remember it is only 90 percent isolate, so 10% has a percentage of lactose which falls inline with the amount of irritation I feel, which is not much.  I continue to take it because it gives me better results than plant based protein with less bloating believe it or not.

I will get straight to the point with this review. I have used tons of protein powders over the years, and within the last 2 years I became very concerned about where my protien powder was being manufactured. Upon doing tons of research on brands strictly made is the USA, and testing many of those brands out I have chosen Bulk Supplements as my go to whey. It is sourced and manufactured in the USA, which first and foremost was the most important factor to me. Now, I am not a body builder by any means, but I am a woman who has always excercised and weight lifting has been a part of my fitness regimen for the last 7 years. At this point I know my protien powders and my body and it’s recovery times well enough to say without a doubt that this is a great protein. I can see an increase in strength, and a reduction in recovery time. I find this powder mixes very well. I mix it with room tempature water and I have no problem getting it to dissolve. I do not “make protien shakes” as I feel the protien serves a purpose, and that’s to help repair and rebuild muscle not casually sip for enjoyment as one would sip a cappuccino or cocktail. With that being said I do not mind the taste. It is a flavorless powder. Does it taste good? No. Does it taste bad? No, it doesn’t really taste at all, but then again I’m not drinking it for pleasure.....I’m drinking it for purpose. Over all for the price and performance this is the best you can get, and it’s made in the USA!!!

My son has a bad habit of not eating before school now that he's 16.  When I offered to make breakfast he's usually just not hungry yet because it's so early. So I knew it was time to make sure he got his protein and other needs and then easy to do way.  So I researched and researched what do I need to get, what would be best for his need.  That's when I came across the way protein.  The first time I decided I was going to be the guinea pig so I made a protein shake and it came out fantastic. I could not taste the powder in anyway, and I didn't notice any foaming.  The next day I tried some milk and I put a little chocolate powder in it.  I stirred it up and had no clumping issues, and I still could not taste the powder. This stuff is fantastic! It's so easy to use  and whatever you want to make on the go. I had no stomach problems no issue. So the hard part with my son notice. So over a week I made smoothies, and did different drinks.  Everything I made he thought was fantastic. I showed him  The protein powder and had him read the information on the bag. Finally my son is taking the time to put the protein and a drink or make a smoothie before he's out the door. And I know in my heart he's getting the things he needs. I cannot thank Bulk supplements enough!!!  Don't change anything you've got a great product!

I've been supplementing whey protein into my diet for the past 6 years and have tried many big name brands but have always had issues with them. Whether it be price, taste, texture or how they would make me feel. I'm not the type to care whether they have artificial sweeteners or not but I must say that I would find the flavors to grow old on me fast and or would downright taste awfully fake this preventing me from wanting to finish the tub. I finally decided to give Bulk Supplements' unflavored Whey Isolate a try as I could mix it with whatever I wanted to adhere to my taste preferences.I have to say that upon opening the ziplock bag it came shipped in I could immediately tell the level of quality protein this was. It's texture is incredibly fine and fluffy. Needless to say its mix-ability is incredible. As its unflavored, the only thing you really notice is a light milky texture it adds to whatever you are mixing it with. This will continue to be my go-to protein supplement moving forward and I can't wait to try the other supplements Bulk Supplements offers.My ONLY criticism is that though I find the quality of the storage bag exceptional for the most past - the ziplock portion is not. Maybe it was just my bag but the zipper did not create a seal that I would feel comfortable with keeping the contents inside without spilling out if tipped over. Luckily I had an empty 2lb container from a previous protein I had taken so I just poured it in there. Problem solved.

This is my first order from BulkSupplements. I had tried some off the shelf protein powders from shoprite/trader joes before, but most of them didn't agree with me. After some online research, I switched to pea protein which worked well for most part except its very caulky taste. I have recently been following advice from a nutritionist who suggested that whey protein is the most easily digestible and complete of all protein supplements. Being a vegetarian, it is a must that I supplement my diet to reach my protein goals. Despite fear of digestive issues from switching back to whey, I decided to give it a try. What was important was to look for quality and clean products. This protein powder is clean, mixes easily with any smoothie without leaving a taste (although I prefer it with water, straight). It's protein-carb-sugar ratio is ideal as per my nutritionist (over 20 grams protein and and less than 5 gram carb/sugar). I like that it has no added flavors (just pure whey isolate, with a bit of soy lecitin as an emulsifier, but it is GMO sourced as per some research so I hope they get rid of this) is from a grass fed source and low in calories. I often still use prain old greek yogurt as my post workout protein, but this is a nice addition to my attempt at clean eating and getting enough protein. My only complaint is the packaging. The zipper portion is flimsy and doesn't adhere well, so I was forced to invest in a jar and transfer contents.

This product got so much hate in the reviews that I ended up buying a different whey protien powder just in case.So, the product I purchased was the 250g bag.  The bag itself is stuffed full, and would not reclose because of the protein stuck in the plastic recloser.  So I put it in a container and moved on.There was no weird smell.  It smelled very lightly like powdered milk.  The taste was a bit neutral to me.As others have pointed out, there is no scoop.  The serving size is listed as 30g, or about 2.5-5 tsp?  I guess mileage may vary on people's teaspoons.  If you are looking to hit specific macro numbers, you might want to get something that definitely comes with a scoop, or invest in a metric kitchen scale if you don't have one.  I don't have one, so I did my best.  I mixed about 2 tablespoons in with some peanut butter.  It tasted just fine.  Also, I did not get ill like some previous reviewers have described when they used this product.My biggest complaint then is the product came with no clear way for me to measure a serving size.  I'm going to guess most people have scales,though, so overall the product is fine.

I used to buy various 10lb bags of more mainstream brand whey proteins. Since trying this specific whey protein, I've been convinced that I'm going to stick to with this brand for the foreseeable future because of a few pros for my situation:1) Cost - A few more servings per bag as compared to other brands of comparable size.2) Size - Slightly smaller size compared to other brands of comparable size. This makes it easier to store in my small living space.3) Convenience - Whereas a lot of proteins are made to be mixed with water in shaker bottles, I've found that I can just mix this in with juice or other drinks (that I'd be drinking anyway) without it clumping, skipping the use of shaker bottles altogether. I found other whey proteins to be too full of fillers that clump to be able to do this.The only one con I have to mention is taste. Without fillers and taste enhancers, this protein may not be agreeable to some people's palates. From reading the reviews, there seems to be two camps of people: those who don't discern any taste and those who find the taste horrible or unpleasant. I found the taste to be very slightly unpleasant if mixed with water. However, the protein's taste will be overwhelmed and unnoticeable if it is mixed with anything that has even the weakest taste, like juice.

We got a great recipe for chocolate peanut butter protein muffins that called for protein powder.  In scanning around, we weren't sure what brand would work best in a baking situation, so we tried this product.  It blended perfectly with the other ingredients and really added no odd flavor or texture to the muffins - which turned out to be the bomb.  My overall issue with any protein powder is that the pricing is all over the place, but felt this was fairly priced for the quality delivered.  My only problem with the product was the zipper seal not working after we opened the bag, but that was solved by a paper clip and putting it into a separate Ziploc bag.

Great Product!This is just a review of the product's taste and mix-ability. The serving size is 30 grams, but for those of us that don't weigh our whey it's just under 1/3 of a cup. 1/3 of a cup is 5 1/3 tablespoons, and the bag indicates that 1/2 a tablespoon is 3 grams. Times .5 by 10 and boom, 5 tablespoons. Now that that's out of the way, the term ""unflavored"" is being thrown around fairly loosely. This whey has the taste and consistency of coffee creamer. That being said, it really goes well with most liquids because it really just adds a milky taste.So far I've combined the whey with:1. Water - Not great. It tastes like instant milk, but if that's your thing, have at it.2. Milk- Not bad, it makes a thicker, creamier shake. Fairly unnoticeable flavor.3. Milk or water with chocolate Nesquik - Great! So far this is my ""go to"" post workout shake. Tastes like any other chocolate whey.4. Orange Juice - Pretty tasty. It kind of tastes like a cheap Orange Julius.5. Apple Juice - Nope! It may just be me, but milk and apples don't pair well.Overall I really do like this product. The powder dissolves easily and I haven't had too many lumps when using a blender bottle. It can be combined to take on new flavors, which adds variety, because there's nothing quite like getting half-way through a five pound container of ""orange creamsicle"" whey just to get sick of the taste.

I like that it’s flavor is basically nothing and don’t notice it changing my smoothie much. The bags suck and don’t reseal.

This is by for the most clean and pure protein I have come across.  I was unsure so I only ordered 250 grams, boy do I wish I had ordered more.  If you aren't looking to break your bank and over spend on protein this is the way to go.  For those that don't know much about the different types of protein out there....Whey Isolate is one of the better routes.  It is some of the most pure and digests the quickest (best for post workout).  If you are looking for a protein that will fill you up for an extended period of time, don't go isolate.  Instead aim for a blend/concentrate or casein.  Personally I tend to get hungry at night so I will drink a casein shake slightly before bed so my body can continue to grow as I sleep or have it in the morning for breakfast.  I received my Whey Isolate quickly and as advertised.  It is very rare that you will find a 90% protein powder, heck it is rare to find anything over 80%.  After all the flavors and fillers added to most big name supps.  Once again if you aren't looking for that candy flavored protein, this is the route to go.  Just straight whey taste, smooth silk iso texture, and if you need flavor add a little ice cream sauce :-)I highly recommend.  Looking forward to trying other products by BulkSupplements.

Finely powdered - mixes easilyGood valueBag is technically resealable, but the zip-lock kind of sucksIt doesn't come with a scoop and the recommended serving is in weight so I had to guestimate -about 1/3 cupWorks well - I had been lifting for years without supplements when I hit a plateau and decided to start. It's been about a month and my muscles are noticeably bigger, and all of my lifts have gone up in weight. Additionally I used to be tired all of the time and never realized it until I started supplementing protein, now I have much more energy and recover more quickly.Only an ingredient - I discovered the hard way that all the reviews about it being ""tasteless"" did not mean it was a good standalone shake mix lol. The first time I tried it I mixed 1/3 cup in about 8oz. of water and it was so gross I nearly threw up... twice. But if you mix it in OJ it goes down ok and it's actually pretty good in chocolate milk. This didn't work well for me because I needed something that I could just mix in water at the gym and be on my way. I have since ordered a different protein shake mix, but I supplement it with a tablespoon of this.

A little faint flavor but a pleaseant one,  seems a little like milk since its whey concentrated.  Its more convenient to buy the 500gr. bag because it last a month for me that I train four times a week with weights and take the supplement these four days and one more the day when I rest.  I use two scoops in a day.  One after training and one before going to bed.  I am also combining lately (few days ago) with the Creatine from BulkSupplements of the same presentation 500g.  aproximate 8 grams a day.  About the results I am very happy and satisfied  with.  First of all my stomach doesn't suffer at all when I take the Whey, it settle very well ,  no heartburn at all,  with creatine its different because I feel a little heartburn for, lets say..ten to fifteen minutes after I dirnk it,  then I feel normal again.  I have notice improvements mostly in my muscles definition so I am very grateful to God, and then with this excellent and great quality supplements that has no added chemicals to its flavor but the natural one.  I have to remind you that the changes you want to see are a result from hard exercise and a suitable supplement like the one from BulkSupplements which is my first option today.

I've tried a LOT of protein powders over the years, and this is my favorite.  Most protein powders come flavored, so you are limited as to how you mix it.  For most of my life, this was not an issue as I was the only one making protein shakes, and vanilla flavored protein powder worked for me.  When my kids became old enough where we wanted to throw some protein into their sugary shakes, I had to deal with their tastes as well.  One wanted vanilla or fruit based shakes and one wanted chocolate.  And all of them disliked the taste of the flavored protein powders.  So the unflavored protein powder from BulkSupplements was the perfect solution.  It mixes well with whatever flavor shake you want (chocolate, vanilla, berry, banana, etc).  I mixed it in milk, and I could barely discern any flavor.  And none of my kids has complained about the protein in their shakes.  My only issue, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that I cannot stand the ziplock on the bag.  It's essentially useless.  I just fold the top over and use a bag clip to keep it closed.

I had been searching for a ""plain"" whey protein that doesn't have any sweeteners or other flavors added. I finally found the product to meet my needs. I first bought BulkSupplements Creatine which lead me to investigate their other products, which lead me to the Whey Protein. I have never liked flavored Whey regardless of brand or flavor. They have always left that nasty artificial sweetener aftertaste. And sometimes I prefer getting a little more simple carbs in and to take an already too sweet protein shake and add more sweetness isn't an option for me.After buying the 1KG of Whey, I have added it to pancake mix and other foods that my kids like to boost their nutritional value for me and them. I've even added it to biscuit mix and I honestly can't tell a difference. Obviously you don't want to eat like that all the time, but I'm pointing out it works. Mix the whey with the dry ingredients first and you'll be good to go.I normally use the whey with 16 ounces of whole milk and 4 tablespoons of NesQuik (for additional carbs) and one teaspoon of BulkSupplements Creatine after my morning workouts for my first meal. I do this instead of breakfast simply for convenience because I don't eat before my workout. If you are looking for no bull crap supplements, you can't go wrong with BulkSupplements.

I love the minimalist packaging of this company's stuff.  No dumb weapon/explosive bro-names and logos (I'm looking at you N.O.-XPLODE, C4, Force Factor® VolcaNO, Jack3D, Pump Fuel v3 INSANITY, MusclePharm® Assault™, GNC Beyond RAW® RAVAGE™, ERECTION JOE'S SUPER SICK XPLOSIVE BRO-TEIN (ok that one I made up), etc, etc, etc).  I hope they keep it this way.As far as the actual product, I haven't been using it long enough to give a real in-depth review for this reason: I had face-melting farts with Whey Concentrate (Optimum Nutrition), and I've had none of that with this.  Everyone around me is appreciative.  The amount of protein you get without all the other junk they put in the concentrates is great, and you don't have to worry about not liking a particular flavor and needing to choke it down to get your money's worth.  This stuff, thus far, has effectively disappeared, flavor-wise, in the stuff I've put it in.Here's a great way to consume this stuff (how I do it at least):  Take a banana, some vanilla greek yogurt, some peanut butter, and some lactose-free milk (I've been using that new FairLife Chocolate Milk aka ""Coke Milk"" because of the increased protein), and a scoop of this.  Throw it all in a magic bullet or equivalent and you've got a delicious protein shake that doesn't taste ""good for a protein shake""- it tastes straight-up GOOD.

BulkSupplements seems to have made a great and affordable ""Pure"" Whey Protein Isolate supplement. This is only my initial reaction to the product, as I have yet to have time to see any results (1 week). The lecithin really helps this powder break down smoothly in any liquid. (sub 120 degrees, don't want it to curdle) With only two ingredients, there is next to no taste, and can be a transparent addition to any shake or juice. I personally drink it in plain water before and after my workouts. The best description of the taste in water is if you were to stir in a couple of tbsp. of milk into 20oz. +/- of water. It is easy to drink and you're avoiding all of the other byproducts contained in other heavily flavoured powders.The packaging is somewhat of a letdown, but I personally don't care... There is no scoop and the ""zip lock"" on the bag is already full of powder when you receive it, so you'll never be able to use it.Summary: 4 stars due to the lack of time to see results and poor packaging. If it does the job it will be hard to beat this isolate @ $0.02/gram.

Product received fully intact and closed, not as some others have complained about. Day 7 of taking 2 servings per day. I'll give another update within 4 weeks. I've taken a ton of different protein powders being a vegetarian for 23yrs now and here's my review.PROS:Love the bag it comes in. Better for the environment rather than a large plastic container and easier to store in the refrigerator.Zero taste. Zero aftertaste. This is of huge importance to me.Not chalky at all, smooth consistencyDissolves very easily in water with just a spoon and zero clumps (see photo)Mixes well in a blender with fruit and recovery powder (see photo of pink drink)Zero gas. No stomach upset. I'm lactose intolerant so this is a big deal as I often have sensitivity issues. Although I think it may be causing mild stomach bloating but I'm still weeding out foods to determine the culprit.Powder is dense, it has a firmness to the texture of the powder so it doesn't easily blow all over the place and make a mess like a lot of powders I've tried.CONS:The zip closure part of the bag doesn't seal great. So I roll it over and use chip clips to keep it sealed. Not that big of a deal.Overall this is a fantastic whey isolate.

****Update 9 January 2017****No changes.  I'm on my fourth bag of Whey Concentrate from BulkSupplements.  It has fully replaced my more expensive Isopure.  It still has the same taste, mixes well, and helps just as good with my recovery.  I still mix mine only with water, but occasionally add some flavor.  I recommend trying a wild variety of flavors like lemon juice, part of a Noosa or Chobani yogurt.  You get the idea.  Anyway, I intend to try some of their other products.  Let ya know.****Original Review Below****BulkSupplements CLEAN Whey Protein Powder is as good as a more expensive whey powder I purchase & use (Isopure Whey Protein Isolate, Unflavored).  BulkSupplements mixes slightly better than the Isopure.  Both smell and taste almost exactly alike (I mix mine with water only, no flavor).  I have not experienced any issues (unexpected bowel movements) or other physical issues people have mentioned.  Additionally, my package was in good shape.  I ordered this with another container of Isopure so I could compare them side by side, daily.Summary: I will be replacing my more expensive Isopure for BulkSupplements.  I will occasionally try another protein to keep everyone honest.  Let you know if anything changes.

I have tried just about every combination of proteins available from various companies. Out of them all, I enjoy bulk supps clean whey. The consistency is of water, tasteless and you can easily mix 60g of whey isolate in one shaker bottle and flavor it with BCAAs and it's not like drinking pudding. Not only does it mix well but you can put it in anything you want and it has a higher protein per serving ratio than the leading competitors. From optimum nutrition to machine whey and animal whey, Bulk supps beats each brand by 3-4g of protein per serving. Only downside is you have to use your own scoop or measuring spoon/cup. But the serving size (amount of powder) is less than the others that I've tried. Instead of only being able to fit one scoop comfortably into a shaker bottle, I can throw 3 of bulk supps in it and I'm fine. Without a blender spring and it still mixes perfectly. The only downside is the bag it comes in, it'll pop open sometimes but that's no big problem, I'd prefer the current bag over spending a few extra dollars for the same amount of whey. Regardless, it's my new favorite protein while I'm on season or off season of bodybuilding or powerlifting.

I got it for free to do a review.  i use powder mostly in my morning shake with all kinds of greens and too many powders and herbs to list here, and also at night before bed because i sleep better on a less than empty stomach :)my fitness protocol consists of full body weights once a week, tabata (10/20) once a week, hot yoga 3x a week, and the tread climber 3x a week.  basically every day i'm doing some kind of exercise and if work gets hectic and i don't have time, then at the office, i take the stairs down 8 stories to the outside and walk around the pond.  so i'm not a fitness fanatic but i do try to move my lazy IT butt at least 20 minutes daily.anyway....- mixes well with almond milk, with no lumps in a glass with plastic fork- no sugar = mild vanilla flavor, so i use stevia or fruit like bananas or berries- no added sweeteners or flavorsI already bought another bag of this.

I recently bought this product, because I cannot stand the taste of flavored protein powders like optimum nutrition, for example. While that product is just fine, the taste really bothers me - so I decided to try something that didn't have any artificial flavors and I came across this product. A lot of people complain about the taste, but to me (and this is very subjective) I would rather drink this than all that flavored stuff out there. I noticed this product foams/bubbles more if you leave it in the blender for too long, but I just put it there for 10 seconds and it mixes really well.I usually drink it with 2 cups of milk, so it is pretty diluted, and there isn't really much taste at all. Sometimes, I mix in half a scoop of optimum nutrition chocolate flavored protein and it gives the drink an ever so slight chocolate taste without any weird after taste. With that said, I don't mind drinking the product by itself at all and will definitely use it as my go-to protein.I also like that there is no weird chemicals or other bogus whatevers in it, it seems to be all natural whey which I really appreciate - and that is a huge added bonus.

Love this protein powder, it mixes really well into my morning breakfast smoothies and no funky after taste.  I've been using it every morning and replaced my old protein powder with this.  It's a much better buy for the price and without any weird after taste or residue.  I'm definitely going to be making a regular order of this product in the future.  The only thing I would say for any one buying this; if you don't already have a storage canister, I would get one as the zipper to the packaging can be a little difficult.  Aside from that though the product is flawless, it wasn't clumpy or packed together when it arrived.  It dissolves easily into liquids compared to other protein powders and makes a great meal substitution when paired as a smoothie-helping fill you up and not be hungry 5 minutes later.  I've managed to lose 3 pounds in the last 10 days of using this with no additional changes to my daily routine, just replaced my old protein powder with BulkSupplements.  Seller also responds VERY quickly if you have any questions or comments and they are very efficient and polite.  I'm already planning on replacing all of my current supplements with their products.

I have not been paid for this review...I was overweight (obese I think is what it's called) for the last 2 decades and have struggled to get my health back the past 6-7 years. Then last year I found the right combination of nutrition, exercise, and supplements. I have been using protein powder (as well as other) supplements the past year as part of my nutrition for weight lifting/strength training.After using flavored ones (chocolate, vanilla) and not really liking the after taste I searched for an unflavored ""clean"" substitute that I can add to anything. After trying this product I can say I think I found my ""winner winner chicken dinner""!!! No bad aftertaste... in fact no taste other than a slight hint of milk. AND it mixes and dissolves completely and can be added to just about anything. I now use it daily in my meal replacement shakes and it also seems to add a nice creamier texture to the shakes. My current favorite is a vanilla meal replacement shake with a scoop of Bulk Supplements Clean Whey Protein, a cup of fresh squeezed OJ, and a cup of ice. Tastes like an orange whip shake but has all the carbs and protein my body needs either pre or post workout.

I bought this brand because I like the other products I have purchased from them, and I was looking for an unflavored protein powder with more protein grams per serving. This one has 27g protein per serving (9 more than my other brand), is unflavored and unsweetened, and it mixes up into milk without clumping. I had no clumps stuck all over the inside of the glass like my other brand of whey protein (which is concentrate, not isolate like this product.) I feel like I'm not wasting product and I'm getting my money's worth. Just be careful when opening the bag- it's vacuum packed and whey will fly everywhere if you don't open it carefully. I saved the container from my other protein and transferred the contents of the bag into it, and I kept the scoop too. A flour canister would work as well if you don't have anything else to put it in. This whey protein has not upset my stomach like other brands I have tried in the past so I am pleased with it. I think the lack of fake colors, flavors, and sweeteners helps with that a lot.Update: My nails are growing noticeably faster since I've been using this product so I can tell it's doing the job.

I was looking for a pure whey protein. One that does not include vanilla or chocolate flavoring and all kinds of additive supplements. Just plain whey if you please. This product is it. Other than an unidentified amount of soy this product is pure whey.  The soy is probably soy lecithin which is commonly used as an emulsifier. The product comes in a thick foil package that is quite strong. It can be punctured by a sharp point but but is unlikely to get ripped or to burst. When I opened the package it had a minor musty smell. But after it aired out for a while the musty smell was gone and the product has  a sweet fruity smell. I store it in the refrigerator. The powder has a very fine texture and is light and fluffy. I add it to my morning cereal mix. It mixes well with the other ingredients. Since it is so fine and fluffy it takes more volume for the same amount weight of  the powder I previously used.  It is an an Amazon Prime product and the price is good. So I will continue to use this product and recommend it to anyone who wants pure whey but can tolerate some soy.

This protein is just fine. I was starting a new 12 week program and needed 5 scoops of something per day. Went with this and am completely happy with what I bought. It is unflavored (though as another reviewer mentioned it does have a powdered milk kind of taste...which isnt bad, but its not ""delicious,"" its just protein water haha). Since it is unflavored, I mix this with my pre and post workout powder, which makes it easy to have everything at once, and not have to have a separate shake for all of them.The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because it is crazy frothy. Put a scoop in with water, mix it up, and you get about as much foam as you do liquid. I just drink the liquid and wash out the foam...no harm. Just odd. If you need bulk protein, can't go wrong with this stuff.

After researching different protein supplements, I decided to try BulkSupplements Whey Protein Powder Isolate, mainly since isolate is supposed to have better bioavailability than the powder, and because of reviews stating that it had the least offensive taste. That's certainly true, for me at least. It does have a taste - I can't exactly put my finger on it, but it kind of vaguely reminds me of plain yogurt, but not as tangy. I'm on a medical weight-loss program that includes a low-carb diet - my most recent body composition analysis showed some muscle mass loss, so I'm trying to increase my protein intake while keeping carbs at a minimum. So far it's been easy (and tasty) adding the powder to my cold drinks, smoothies, and yogurt concoctions. It mixes well, and the mild taste is easily hidden by the flavors of whatever I'm mixing it into. Unlike a lot of other reviewers, I haven't had a problem with the packaging. I let the contents settle for a day after I received it, then carefully cut open the 1 kg bag. No giant poof of powder. Instead of trying to zip the bag, I rolled the top & used a bag clip. I'll be purchasing this product again!

Definitely saw some results after going to gym whenever I could and ate a sufficient amount of protein. This stuff, is tasteless, meaning it's not pretty to gulp down. I'd mix it with cocoa powder or something of the sort or blend it in with fruit smoothie if it's that intolerable for those others out there. My weight was more or less the same throughout the whole time.A minor thing I'd like to note is that it started to make my protein shaker smell funky as I use this product. One day a bit of the powder actually coagulated into some adhesive state, almost like wet gorilla glue which took a couple of runs in dishwasher to actually get off!Otherwise I think I could've seen better results due to my lifestyle choices. I'd definitely buy the 20kg bag next time as soon as I completely exhaust this 1kg bag, as well as re-evaulate my lifestyle *cough cough ALCOHOL*

This is a very clean Whey Protein powder mix that does not have all of the additives like some of the other protein powders out there. It is very easy to mix and does not have a thick or heavy after taste at all. I mix mine up with some soy milk, yogurt and fresh fruit for a great smoothie. If you are looking for something with more flavor I would suggest making sure you order one with that already mixed in as this one has zero flavors but that makes it good to add to multiple juices and such. That just makes it have a thinner texture than a traditional protein powder but again that is good if you mix it with a juice as well.I would give it 5 stars except for the packaging. The zip lock type bag can be messy after opening and the fact that it does not come with any type of scoop makes it more difficult than it should be. Besides that, it is a very good and clean protein mix.

I am not a professional body builder but simply someone whom tries to live/eat healthy......for most of the time. I've tried a few other protein products that you can easily find on the market either online or in store. Unfortunately, either ended up with upset stomach or the taste is just terrible to deal with. Plus, for those of you who've been using protein, you would know some of them are hard to mix well and the chunky feeling is not enjoyable with the disgusting taste. Things being said, this protein is fairly nice product. It practically doesn't taste anything but it's not EXACTLY tasteless. When it's mixed with Gatorade, it does alter the taste a bit but not disgusting. When it's mixed with juice, same thing. One big thing I appreciate is the fact that it dissolves EASILY. I put them into juice, stir a bit and let it sit for couple of minutes, it's completely dissolved. All I can tell is that there is a little foam on top, no chunk or particles left behind. I have not used it for long enough to share whether this is good for muscle building/recovery yet, but if it is, I will definitely stick with it.

So far I used Gold Standard from Optimum Nutrition and in comparison the Golden Standard has better taste and so far it was better blended in the protein shake. I put this BulkSupplement only twice into blender and once somehow a lot of protein stuck together into small balls that tasted like tasteless bubble gums. And also a lot of it remained glued at the bottom of blender. This is the bigger problem for me so far and this is why four stars.As for the taste - as I said it is tasteless and somehow I can feel the difference even though I put a lot of different ingredients into my shake. But it is actually my own choice. The better taste of Gold Standard comes from additional ingredients, including sucralose and artificial flavors and it also has bigger sodium content. So I think I will continue to use BulkSupplements because it is one of the purest proteins (at least as declared). I didn't remove stars because of taste as it is natural ""sacrifice"" here.

I never appreciated protein powders that are loaded with dangerous artificial sweeteners and flavors. Being a health conscious person, I wanted something that is pure and clean, so I thought I'd try this brand.The first disappointment when opening the bag was not finding a scoop ! Anyway, because I had scoops from other whey products it wasn't a big problem. However, the powder is not easily measured in a scoop because of the fluidity of the powder, so better weigh the serving on a scale.The taste and smell are slightly unappealing, but the powder mixes very well, in fact much better than other powders I tried lately.Bottom line. Whey protein does not have to taste good, whats important is the protein content. Flavor can be enhanced naturally by mixing with milk and adding cocoa and sugar. To me, a few calories more  is better than a low calorie shake filled with dangerous artificial sweeteners. I recommend this product to everyone, and I'm planning on using it again.

I was interested in switching to a clean protein because all the added chemicals and flavorings in other proteins had a tendency to make me feel a little sick.  The sweeteners added always taste disgusting to me as well.  I've had this product for a couple weeks now and I love that the product is flavorless so I can add extra protein to my almost any meal.  Add it to oatmeal, coffee, cereal, soups, and of course the ever favorite smoothies.  I will say that it does not blend the easiest with just a spoon as it tends to leave a few powder clumps, but it blends just fine with a shaker bottle or blender.  I've definitely had proteins that blended worse, and in all fairness, I've never met a protein that you could blend smoothly with just a fork or spoon.  My only real con is that it did not come with a scoop, so I'm never sure exactly how much I'm getting.  (Unless it's buried somewhere in the bag!)  I've already recommended this to several of my gym friends, and some strangers as well.  I will definitely continue to purchase this.

I've used a couple of different brands of protein power in the past and they always ended up with a horrible chemical aftertaste. After some digging around for other options I decided to give whey isolate a try instead since isolate has less lactose and fat in addition to not having the sweeteners and artificial flavorings that regular protein powders have. Since I've had good experiences buying from BulkSupplements in the past, I opted to go with theirs and I wasn't disappointed.The isolate fresh out of the bag is a bit grittier than non-isolate whey powders but it dissolves much more easily in liquids. I'm also happy to report it doesn't have the nasty aftertaste either. Others have described the aftertaste of the isolate as ""slightly milky"" and that is quite accurate but it is subtle enough it doesn't overpower. The serving size of 30 grams translates to two tablespoons of powder and each serving has 27 grams of protein. The only ingredients per the package are diary derived whey protein isolate and soy lecithin used to emulsify.All-in-all it was a great purchase and I will buy this again. It is perfect for mixing in smoothies and yogurt to give them an extra protein boost.

The product came shipped as described. This is my first order from Bulk Supplements. I have only recently started researching bulk products. I am a 23 year old male and I am very active with physical activity. I have tried many products and spent a decent amount of money over the years. Having recently gotten very tired of all the marketing hype that is associated with fitness products I started researching bulk, clean and verified for purity products. I like that the recipe is very simple and that it seems to not have very much additive. Pretty much just pure protein (hopefully). I drink it with Chocolate milk so I still get a chocolate protein shake, and I use just about 30 grams using a previous protein box's scoop. Overall the taste is great, and it mixes very easily. I did try it with water the first time and that was not exactly the greatest taste, so I suggest using milk or chocolate milk for sure. There are probably other ways to get the chocolate flavoring but for now this seems to work fine for me.Overall Great product, love the fact that it is straight forward and simple with the ingredients.

I was somewhat skeptical of reviewers that claimed this powder could be mixed easily with juice and you not taste the powder.  Having used many products over the years I was used to clumpy, odd tasting powders that had to be mixed with something in order to make the shake tolerable. A product's taste is very subjective and even though the last product I used was well reviewed I did not care for it. I figured it was worth trying something new and I really wanted the other reviewers to be correct.I mixed a single serving with orange juice in my shaker bottle and sure enough it was barely noticeable.  The same was true when I mixed it in Greek yogurt with some fresh fruit. I could not taste it and it did not add a gritty texture to the yogurt as other products have.  It is just what it states, ""CLEAN Whey Protein.""  I did not realize just how much ""flavor"" was in all the additives used in other brands.  I guess not tasting is believing.I like the hype-free packaging. BulkSupplements could improve the bag by widening the base as it tends to fall over.  A 2 KG option would be nice as well.

My main purpose in purchasing this protein was to help my daughter's defenses, which I found just by chance that happened with whey protein, as well or maybe better than Vitamin C. The brand I was using and trusting was discontinued in my country, so I urgently needed to find a good replacement. And BulkSupplements's just passed the test with flying colours!First and way most important, my kid has not catch even one flu or any other infection within 3 months that I've been using it with only 5-6 servings a week, which is a great success.Secondly, but not unimportant for a child, it has no taste, so she can combine it with any of her fave flavours and it doesn't change them, even with just plain milk. And please note, my daughter has a very sensible nose/taste!Third, it dissolves super-easily into warm milk, but also easily with fridge-cold milk or yogurt. It doesn't do well with hot milk, though.Fourth, the price can't be beaten.Fifth, the service and delivery was flawless.I tried but I couldn't find a sixth thing to ask for, so this is perfection for me. I feel very grateful with the provider and I would and had definitely recommend it to anyone.

There are very few products I feel I am qualified to review as an absolute expert!  Protein just happens to be one of them - as an avid Ironman, marathon and cycling participant = protein is a core ingredient for all aspects of my training.  I utilize multiple types of protein (Whey, Whey Isolate and Casein) for different aspects of my prep and different amounts depending on time of the year (bulking or cutting) and even time of day ((whey and whey isolate morning and post workout and casein for evening).  There are very few protein brands and types I have not tried - the key for me is a protein that is as close to 4 calories per gram of protein and very few ""fillers"" with a quality range of BCAA's (Branched Chain and complete Amino Acids). When I saw Bulk Supplements Whey Isolate and reviewed the product content I was eager to try and I'm glad I did!  The overall structure, taste and value are unsurpassed in the supplement world and that is saying a lot!  Since my initial Whey Isolate purchase I have added CLA, DHEA, and Casein Bulk Supplements products and completely satisfied with every product!  Great work Bulk Supplements!

I love this protein powder!#1 you get an incredible deal : it’s “isolate” whey for less than the price of generic “concentrate”.#2 it’s pure and free of any additional macros therefore you can add ingredients to it based on your Macros. Add milk for extra calories or low calorie nut milks for reduced caloric intake.#3 texture and taste wise it resembles baby formula and that says a lot about the quality.#4 tips: if you are using this to reach your daily  protein needs on a fat loss faze, do yourself a favor and don’t drink your calories. Do not drink this as a shake unless you’re really in a hurry. People should eat food more than drink smoothies.Extra tips: take one serving of this protein, add one egg, 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1 or 2 tbsp of water and mix well. Preheat your waffle iron and pour this mix in. In about 3 minutes you’re left with amazing low calorie protein rich waffles that taste amazing.Enjoy!

I purchased this product to supplement my daily protein intake. I am a woman who practice a ketosis diet and perform high intensity interval training along with other strenuous physical activities. Needless to say, my body requires a great deal of protein! I have found this product to be a fantastic way to accomplish that end. I mix it with water in a blender bottle and drink it up. It has a little bit of a taste, but I do not find it to be offensive. It kind of tastes like powdered milk, go figure! I love that it does not have a bunch of ingredients that not even chemists can pronounce. It has caused me some GI bloating, but nothing that is too terrible. I will say that my spouse also drinks it in the same manner as I do, and he has had many troubles with heartburn afterwards. That being said, he has ameliorated this side effect by taking pre and probiotics daily (which are just a good thing). With those supplements, he has had no issues.

I think the protein has done it’s job. This was my first protein ever and I think I picked good. I’ve had days where I’ve used it and days I haven’t and I think it’s shown. Obviously it’s hard to tell because growth also relies on your routine, but I do see growth. So it does its job as a protein. As a Mocha flavor though, it’s debatable. It is good, but it has this aftertaste that I don’t really like. I’ve had it with water, milk, and a smoothie but the aftertaste is still there. I like chocolate so that’s why I got it, but maybe consider a different flavor. Another thing, this may be a user error but every time i mix it there’s always some clumps of the powder. I don’t have any fancy shakers or anything I just use a fork or just shake the bottle really hard. (I usually find the shaking method better) Overall, I would recommend but maybe try something other than the chocolate flavor

Everyone knows Optimum Nutrition is the best protein powder on the market so I'm not gonna say anything about that. My review is about the reviews claiming this is fake. Mine, too, came without a seal. This did worry me as older protein powders from ON came with one. So, when I ran out, I ordered directly from ON and it came without a seal as well. The only seal the company direct one had was on the outside of the lid and it had the normal shiny hologram on that plastic seal. So, you don't need to worry about it being real or not because it is confirmed that newer ON protein tubs come without the inner seal now.

This is my 3rd Mocha Cappuccino and LET ME TELL YOU!!!! This flavor is 100/10 and even better with milk. It very indulgent and like a sweet treat that I just want to keep sipping. If you are tired of chocolate and vanilla AND like a bit of slightly sweet coffee flavor, GET THE MOCHA CAPPUCCINO!  It blends really nicely by shaker or handheld mixer. Good with water (aim for 6-8oz or less for better flavor...unless you feel like consuming more liquid?) but try it with your choice of milk. Adding in an espresso shot makes it even better :)

Got the Mocha Cappuccino flavor. As expected, the package arrived in a box and the product safety tampering seal was dislodged and stuck in the lid (this is caused by heat separating the glue, as long as a white paper is inside your lid then it had a safety seal at one point). Some brown paper was used to prevent rolling around but otherwise nothing else (and nothing else needed).My review will include a couple of the important points, but I won't go into too much detail.Previous powders used:Body Fortress Super Advanced Whey Isolate -- ChocolateElite Series Whey Protein -- Strawberry SmoothieCompared to the Body Fortress, the mixing is easier and isn't as clumpy. It's also for some reason easier to digest (a lot less burping and no upset stomach). The Optimum Nutrition (ON) tastes less strong, so it can definitely be used with something like peanut butter and you'd barely to moderately taste the protein.Compared to the Elite Series, ON is about equal in mixing but is still a little less clumpy. The taste is night and day; much, much less ""fake"" flavor. Digestion is many times better, the Elite Series would make me sick to my stomach and I eventually just gave up after using half the container.I give it a 4 because the flavor doesn't really replicate mocha cappuccino. It's a very mild cocoa flavor, with a bit of coffee as an aftertaste. If you've ever had semi-sweetened watered down cocoa, that's about the flavor I would say this has. Smooth texture, easy to consume, and I definitely recommend it as a versatile flavor that can be consumed joyfully by itself or with additions (like a banana and peanut butter) without making it taste like an awful nutrient concoction.

Mocha is the way to go... I love the taste.  The mocha cappuccino flavor leaves no funny aftertaste that some protin powders do and its not overly sweet....it actually quite delicious.  I substitute my mocha shake for my second cup of coffee so I thought this flavor would probably work best.  I am NOT very hungry when I wake up in the morning so I have used this to replace breakfast so they don't usually even eat by mixing it with 8oz almond milk and a tablespoon of red powdered maca (also very delicious and less expensive from nuts.com). This gives me what I need for my afternoon workouts.  A 2lb container contains  28 servings based on a 6-8oz shake and the scoop is 32g in other words no gigantic shaker necessary.  There is 120 calories and 15mg of naturally occuring caffeine per 6-8oz serving. This is meant to be used as a food supplement not used for weight reduction in other words replace one of your meals with it and the eat a balanced amount of protein throughout the day. Alergen precaution: it contains milk and soy (lecithin)ingredients.  I will probably try other flavors just for the experience but I am perfectly happy with this flavor and will return to it if I don't find something I like even better.  I would totally recommend this product and flavor for anybody wanting a yummy protein shakes the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because you would think that you would get more serving for 2 pounds at only 6-8oz servings.

I'm switching from 0 carb isopure and let me tell you it has always been a struggle for me to drink supplements because of the taste. I've only ever used isopure (strawberries & cream) and it's been my daily shake for years on and off after working out. The problem was I could never stay consistent with it because I hate the taste. I only liked isopure because it was zero carbs and 50g of whey protein (2 scoops). Sometimes after a hard workout I wouldn’t mix any isopure because the taste made me gag.So now here I am with optimum gold standard and I can’t believe I ever forced myself to drink disgusting things—for so long! This shit actually tastes good and I can’t believe it. One scoop contains 24g of whey protein and matching isopure’s serving size of 2 scoops—it’s basically 50g and that’s all I need.Let me say this again this actually tastes good! This is a drink that one can definitely stay consistent with. I believe a consistent diet is truly the key to massive gains.Note: I’ve only tested the mocha cappuccino so far and it tastes great cold and at room temperature.

I'm new to protein powder so if you're looking for professional/advanced advice, I don't have it. From the reviews and various columns praising this stuff I've added this to my regular workout routine. I must say it makes the before and after affects of exercise feel much better. Overall my body feels good and I don't feel like I've ""worked up"" an appetite right after I'm done. So in essence it's helped curb snacking or the need for wanting to fill up on food directly after a workout while trying to lose weight. For newbies like me, the jar is sold by weight and not the size of the container so don't freak out if it's not filled to the top with powder. It comes with a little scoop inside that may be buried under the powder. You also might want to invest in a ""shaker"" bottle to mix the powder in liquid. I started off with stirring it first and it still tasted okay. As for flavor, the Mocha Cappuccino flavor isn't bad at all. It doesn't carry an aftertaste and it's a tolerable enough to drink more than once a day. These days I don't even taste the Mocha anymore and it's become just a foamy liquid drink to me. I highly recommend.

In need of a new flavor, I ordered the mocha. I was going in blind on this brand, having never tried it. The price at the time of purchase was great, the reviews lined up well sso I purchased. And I'm glad I did. The taste was good but not flavorful, however,  a big improvement on other brands. Chocorute remains the flavor king in my opinion, but this one is up there. Abig factor for me were two things: servings and price. The serving count is strong for the price, throw in the mix the quality ingredients and good taste, this is a steal for anyone looking for a new protein powder. A bonus is that it consistently mixes well, hot or cold. Will order again.

ON was a recommendation I found through research of protein powders and their effectiveness. This stuff has an average taste {for protein powders} and does what it is supposed to.The two slight problems I have with it are that it smells awful when added to liquid (hold your nose while drinking), which is expected but also the container of powder could be half the size. It’s what all companies do I guess; use large containers for advertisement. It could be the same container used for their five pound powder because you get this container that is probably ¼ full of powder. The large container takes up space and makes it unlikely to fit in cupboards but it works so I guess it can just take my bed.So really it gets five stars because this product does do as advertised, if you work out you will see additional results with the use of this product. Fight through the smell and if you are serious into getting big then get the five pound powder, it’s usually worth it. I do like the Macho Cappuccino flavor but I will try others in the future and update this post to tell you how that ends up tasting.

I think this is the best favor out of all available favors here. This is my first time using protein powder and buying this favor is so good (with milk) that I treat this like eating ice cream (of course; in this sense, you would be indulging every morning and night haha). But I never thought these protein powder would taste great at first (always thought they taste like your grandfather's medicine flax drink and you would have to stick it up and drink it). This is the best protein out there in the market, only about 1g of fat which is nothing (I usually put two scoops with milk filled to the brink on my blender bottle after a intensive weigh lifting) and 46g of direct protein! This will make your muscle's lean and even more!I recommend getting the the ON Casein Protein powder (take this when you sleep which will slowly digest the protein overnight for your muscles to grow/stay at that level) and ON Creatine Powder sustains muscle, so you should check it out.usually Bodybuilding.com has a cheaper deal on ON products (because they are the top-selling distributor on the internet forums)

Product:Optimum Nutrition is and has always been a leader in protein, it does exactly what whey protein is supposed to do and without the marketing of additional supplements not typically necessary for the average person ...I said average before you fanboys jump down my throat.  This is my first try with the mocha cappuccino and it's actually not bad, I may actually mix it with a little cold brew coffee and ice tomorrow morning.  No, O.N. isn't the best tasting protein but it's not terrible and it works great!  It's also a flavor that's not bad by itself and it mixed really easily.For those of you complaining about the vanilla(s), here's what I suggest that has made it one of my favorites:• 1 Spoonful Almond Butter• Honey yogurt (I prefer Trader Joes)• 1 Banana• Ice• Almond Milk (or regular if you prefer)• I sometimes throw Blueberries & Strawberries in the mix.Shipping:Ordered Saturday night, arrived in time for post workout Monday evening.

Cost per gram of protein:  5/5 this product is one of the most cost effective protein supplements on the market, inexpensive to fit into your daily regimen .2. Mixability: 5/5 I have such a tough time when I get lumps in my protein, it's terrible tasting and makes me not want to drink it. When I was using this protein I noticed no lumps, even after putting it down for a few minutes.3.Taste:  5/5 The chocolate flavor is the best out of any protein powders that I've ever tried.

Just received it a couple of days ago, I had not been working out due to a hamstring injury so I was eager to get back into a routine and I was looking for the right supplement.  It seems like they are too expensive, or so cheap they taste like crap, and most are full of artificial ingredients. I ordered the Mocha!  Mixed with unsweetened Almond Milk, half a banana, and one tablespoon of peanut butter, it made one of the best protein shakes I've had.  It does have a small amount of artificial ingredients, but is mostly whey and cocoa, which I like.  Compared to most other protein supplements, short of buying pure whey (which is hard to choke down) this is a better option in my book.I have the 2 1/2lb. container and at one shake a day it seems like it will last awhile.  All in all, not the cheapest or maybe the best, but in my opinion it is easily the best value for folks looking for a protein supplement to their diet.

Pretty easy choice... high quality whey protein, majority isolate but with some bcaa and other building blocks which is not a bad thing despite a lot of the ""100% isolate"" hype. Great for immediate pre and post workout. Get a casein/blend product for morning and nights and you're set. The flavor of the mocha cappuccino is awesome. The double chocolate also very good but I think I like the cappuccino even better. Mixes easy and digests easy. Slighty more expensive than some other great options too but they call it gold standard for a reason ;)

If you're looking to get more protein in without a bunch of extra junk, this is the stuff you want. I rarely enjoy protein flavors but the Mocha Cappuccino is quite good, it's more of a coffee aftertaste but it's not gross at all. Can help cravings a bit as well, if I drink one instead of going for candy it curbs the desire for sweets. Grab a blender and you can make some great smoothies as well.A heads up, the rim seal does come off sometimes. It may look like it was unsealed but if you flip the cap over you'll see it in there. Happened twice to me so just a heads up.

It's perfect for what I'm looking for, which is a good tasting powder to supplement, low in sugar, and reasonable in price. My favorites are the Milk Chocolate and Mocha Cappuccino, both of these I think taste great just mixed with water or almond milk, and the chocolate tastes great mixed with various fruit or peanut butter. I also like to blend a scoop of the mocha, some ice, a cup of coffee, and some almond milk which makes a delicious after workout treat or a quick breakfast. There's no chalky texture or weird aftertaste with any of the flavors I've tried. It's also not overly sweet and is low in sugar. I definitely recommend this powder, and it works perfectly for my goals.

I'm a hard-gainer with an overly lean frame, so I knew I shouldn't skimp when it comes to whey.  Been using the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard for several months now, and it's the best whey isolate I've ever used (but that's common knowledge anyway, there seems to be a consensus in the fitness community that this brand is the best).The Mocha flavor is really good, the best one I've had so far out of three (Strawberry Banana, Double Chocolate, and this).  As I said, I'm not a coffee drinker, and this is still my favorite.  Protein shakes always still manage to taste worse to me, compared to a standard milkshake of the same flavor.  This one was different - something about the coffee flavor does a great job of masking the ""protein shake"" taste.  Mix this with milk and it tastes just like a coffee-flavor shake from a creamery.

Tastes really good! I was surprised, especially since I don't usually like the taste or texture of whey powder.  I put this in the Silver Bullet with ice cream and milk for milkshakes (for the kids), or with just soy milk for myself.  My kids are picky, and they really like it.  It mixes in easily in both cases - no clumping or dry powder residue to deal with.  Now I have higher protein content and much less sugar in my daily shake, compared to the Carnation Instant Breakfast I'd been drinking for many years. And no, I wasn't compensated in any way for this review.  This is a good product and I'll definitely order more.

Mocha Cappuccino.  With unsweetened Vanilla almond milk it tastes like powdered hot cocoa.  Pretty delicious.I do recommend if you dont use a blender,  to let it sit for a few mins after using a shaker or stirring like crazy. The lumps will disappear after a few min sitting. Blender, otherwise, no lumps that way.

I'm pretty skeptical about protein powders because of the texture.  This one has literally been my all time favorite and I will use the entire tub instead of throwing it away. It's that good! I mixed it with water and coffee instead of milk/almond milk. The texture is so smooth and not grainy or Powder like one bit. I will definitely be ordering this from now on. It makes it easy to mix with my coffee and substitutes my creamer for taste. Yum!

This flavor is delicious! Sometimes I just want to drink it without doing any workout at all just because it tastes so good! It even throws off my workout routine because all I want to do is drink it when my workouts are over. So you know, faster workout = quicker protein intake = happy belly.In the time I've used this, I did see a lot of change in my physique. Though I will forever have a fat build, I was finally able to, for the first time in a very long time, see through my fat and see my thought-to-be-non-exsistent muscles. I think this works.

If you're a fan of creamy coffee drinks, then chances are that you're going to love this protein powder.  It's good enough with just water, but when you're looking for more substance & you add milk, that's when it becomes downright amazing.  When mixed with milk, this protein powder seriously rivals drinks like Starbucks Frappuccino drinks.  Perhaps the coffee taste isn't as strong as those drinks, but it's definitely there and it's good.  Hopefully I didn't overstate how tasty this protein powder is, but I'm just stating my personal thoughts on it, so take them as you may.  In all honesty, it's hard to go wrong with Optimum Nutrition when it comes to whey protein and this is a perfect example of another great flavor from them.

I have never had a protein powder that I actually enjoyed drinking until I tried this one.  I chose the mocha powder and just mix it with water with one of those mixing cups with a wire ball.  It mixes better than my previous protein powder which would leave un-dissolved balls  which were disgusting.Do wash your cup mixed your drink in right away or it starts to smell.  I usually make it in the morning and drink it in the car.  If I don't take it in at night it really stinks the next morning.So, with both taste and consistency this is probably the best protein powder I have ever tried.

Really like this FLavor. It has a very natural flavor where the cookies and cream was ok, but a bit too sweet.  Next to the double chocolate flavor this is my favorite.  And all the flavors I have tried have blended very well.  Note,  I do mix these with either milk or almond milk rather than water.

This is probably the best tasting protein powder I’ve ever tried. It blended great with just cold water in a blender bottle with the wire whisk ball. There was barely any detectable unwanted aftertaste. That alone makes this easier to sip and enjoy versus chugging it to avoid nasty chalky yucky aftertastes with other protein powders I’ve tried. Finally, a sip-able protein. Another great plus is the caffeine. This is definitely going to be my take along breakfast for work. Thanks for a great product.

I’d you’re looking for a protein powder that is true to its flavor with no bad aftertaste, this is the way to go. I’ve mixed it with water and the flavor is prominent and does not seem diluted at all. Not overly sweet, but definitely gives the taste of a coffee flavored beverage. Easily mixed, although when chilled it will begin to stick to the sides of the container. Give it a quick shake and you’re good to go.

Purchased the chocolate mocha flavor - it is very subtlely flavored with mocha AND chocolate. Flavor is alright, mixes okay, nothing special.

Quality wise the is one of the best and most trusted brand in the business. You are getting everything they claim on the level plus more. One of the few company's that does not spike their protein. They own there own dairy farm in America so you don't have to worry about them import their protein from outside our country.

I'be tried 3 flavors from this brand: vanilla, double chocolate, and mocha. My favorite so far of them is the mocha! It doesn't have a super strong chocolate flavor, but still has that coffee-y type of flavor profile I'm looking for. It's definitely more flavorful than the double chocolate too. The vanilla is pretty sweet, so I like to add this to my ice cream, pancake batter, and smoothies instead of injesting it.

I've tried a lot of different proteins and have a pretty fine threshold for taste tolerance (too sweet, etc.).  Mocha Cappuccino is a pretty subtle coffee-ish (frappachino?) flavor and is easy to consume daily.  I find all the ON gold standard flavors to mix fairly well.

It's one of the better powders that are out there, though I was expecting more of a coffee main flavor rather than chocolate main flavor. Dissolves pretty well, and does not leave you feeling weird after you drink it. It tastes fine if you like chocolate shake flavor, and it has a slight coffee taste to it. Does not taste strange or fake. Satisfies your hunger for several hours. Good product.

I bought this product for my husband. He has now finished the product. He wanted something that would help provide nutrients as he is working out more now. I believe the product is ok, but I think we were looking for something that would help him bulk up a little. It did not help with muscle mass but it did provide energy. I have used the product as well but not as much as him. I don't believe it taste like cappuccino so much as I was an avid cappuccino drinker. It more has a vanilla and chocolate mix kind of flavor.

This review is for the Mocha Cappuccino flavor.Overall, I am very satisfied with this product. After every workout, I mix milk with a scoop of powder and mix it with the Blender Bottle. The result is a clump-free, scrumptious concoction that I end up chugging in a matter of seconds. The flavor is great and, as stated by many other reviews, tastes like a less sweet but delicious Starbucks Frappuccino.I'd highly recommend this flavor and brand. I've had a try of my friend's Banana flavor, and I've got to say it's next on my list!

I bought the mocha flavor and was at first thrown off by the smell.  It smells like tootsie rolls, which I do not like.  However, it has a nice coffee taste, not too strong or fake, and dissolves very well!  I previously used EAS whey protein and it was impossible to get all the clumps out.  This is much better!

First off I very only tried th peanut butter chocolate. When I was looking for a protein I wanted somthing with clean ingredients and little to no sugar. The flavor of this protein is spot on and not overly sweet like so many. I find myself craving it as a snack. I prefer taking with whole milke for extra calories. It mixes well with smoothies.the fact that it has probiotics is a plus. I am also a fan of Jocko and what he stands for. I am very satisfied with this protein. Looking forward to purchasing more of this protein and other products on the jocko line.

The chocolate flavor is probably the worst I’ve ever drank but after the first couple sips you honestly can’t taste it anymore. Just a hint of flavor. I think that has a lot to do with the casein protein in it. Even in the smallest amounts you can never make casein protein taste decent. The nutrients aren’t as good as a brand like Isopure but there are pros and cons.  My review is based on strictly mixing with water, which I believe is the baseline for all powders.Con: not as premium with same vitamins and minerals. Taste is very mild (chocolate).Pros: Has casein protein which is slow release for all day and night recovery. You will absolutely feel full after throwing down two scoops of this. Probiotic in it. Casein protein is notorious for not mixing well but this mixes with no clumps even with the bare minimum of water. So you’re definitely not going to leave anything stuck to your shaker bottle. Low carbs for those on keto.Would I buy this again? No way. Is it a solid attempt at being a high performance premium protein. Absolutely. This for sure would also be a good wind down evening drink. Your body repairs itself at night and this protein blend will keep them gainz fed.Price point is solid for the type of product. So no buyer’s remorse there. The taste (chocolate) just lacks. It’s not bad but it’s not even close to being ok. It’s just mehhhhh. I’m sure if you made some sort of shake with this the flavor profile would be adequate or neutral. Bought and have no remorse but this is it. One and some for me.

I use an immersion blender to mix this up and it blends very well.  The resulting shake (made with whole milk) is creamy, frothy, and absolutely delicious!  None of that artificial sweetener after-taste with this one.  Excellent protein shake; the best-tasting one I've ever tried and it provides everything I need.  Will definitely buy it again as it's cost-effective too.  Some of those other shakes are ridiculously overpriced.

I’ve read all the reviews on here I can only speak for one flavor which is chocolate I feel that’s the safest to go with and that’s always been the safest one I also add it with 1% milk I never do protein powders with water I’m not a big protein powder with water fan also when you have protein powders with milk you get more protein with the milk I also use a shaker that has one of those mixer balls on the inside certainly it took me more shakes to get it to the consistency of other protein powders that I’ve had so I would definitely recommend getting one of those shake mixers with a ball inside and I just shake it up  and it mixes OK the first few shakes I did it was a little bit clumpy not terribly clumpy a tiny bit clumpy and So just a few more shakes most of the very small clumps were gone well it’s not even really a big issue I’m a big flavor guy by the way a something doesn’t taste good I don’t want it I won’t have it  this wasn’t the best chocolate protein powder that I’ve ever tasted but then again this is probably the first one that I’m having without artificial flavor like sucralose in it which I’m not really keen to put into my body I like this because it has all quality natural ingredients the price seems pretty decent and the flavor is not too bad at all you know and I guess if you were mixing it at home you could always throw some strawberries or banana in it and it would certainly enhance the flavor but if you’re just putting in a mixer with water I can’t say  what it would taste like with water or how it would mix with water I’ve mixed it with 2% milk and 1% milk and with using a shaker with one of the balls inside it has mixed no problem little bit more effort than usual on other protein powders and the flavor has been fine as well no issue with that I can’t speak of other flavors I probably won’t order the other flavors maybe I’ll try the mint chocolate at some point but I like chocolate and always find chocolate a safe option. I hope this helps people decide I’ve been drinking protein powders for almost 30yrs so a know when some powders have bad taste and this flavor is just fine

So I bought the banana flavor, and this review will be covering that. If you are more concerned about the actual proteins and the stuff inside the mix, and want to compare this between other brands to figure what's best for your workout plan -  then there are other reviews for that... I'm mostly going to talk about the mouth feel and flavor instead! Banana is my favorite breakfast drink/smoothie flavor of choice, and I tend to be really picky with stuff like this, and so far most of the banana flavored powders I've tried have been either wayyyy too sweet, or the banana flavor is so faint I can barely taste it. Jocko mölk however, is not like those other brands! It's very banana, but not too overwhelmingly in a ""candy-like"" (think Laffy taffy) flavor way, but in a ""I blended up a real banana"" flavor way - which is what I was craving! Some people love chocolate, and I'm like that with bananas lol, what can I say? I could always blend an actual banana up of course, but sometimes I'm in a rush and milk+powder in a shaker cup is all I have time for, which this stuff is great for! One thing is no matter how much I mix it in a shaker cup, is there will always be a few chunky bits in my drink, but it's mostly at the bottom and that's pretty much a universal thing everyone deals with. When I use the powder in the blender, I don’t have that problem... Anyways, bonus points as Jocko mölk is a funny name, and makes me laugh every time I open up my cabinet and see the label. 10/10 would mölk again!

Disclaimer: I'm biased. I drink Jocko Go energy drink daily and also use one of the supplements. I'm a huge fan of American made products and cutting out artificial sweeteners.Taste: I expected the taste to be below average. I've used several other whey proteins in the past that have been either sweetened with sugar or artificial sweeteners. Monk fruit has a distinct taste, so I was expecting it to come through on the vanilla flavor. I don't really notice the taste of the monk fruit and the taste is fairly bland, which is good for breakfast smoothies.Mix: it blends very well for me. I didn't have any clumping at all. We'll see over time as I get new jars if the mixing stays consistent, but it's good so far, even in a standard shaker.Amino acids: I love this blend of BCAAs. Jocko really puts in effort to make sure each product is top notch and this is no different.

I've tried three other Jocko Mölk flavors and this one is surprisingly one of their better ones. I'll usually mix one scoop with a little over one cup of plain greek yogurt for a banana pudding like texture and taste. It mixes fine with my greek yogurt but like their other flavors, it doesn't mix well with water or milk and you'll need a blender. It also works well with fruit smoothies.

I had no idea who Jocko Willink is prior to this purchase and bought Jocko Mölk on a whim based on the ingredients and price, so I think my review is unbiased. This stuff is good. The ingredients are simple and there's a decent variety of protein types and sources. It's very filling and has been great for fighting hunger, especially when blended with a cup of milk (I've only tried the peanut butter flavor so far and definitely recommend it). I've been able to hit my protein targets much more easily on weight lifting days without having to consume large portions of food. I'm trying to burn a substantial amount of fat, and taking Mölk has definitely helped me to reach my nutritional goals and lose weight while building muscle instead of losing it despite being in a calorie deficit.

The flavor is horrible in my opinion.  Almost any other protein I have tried tastes better than this.  But the quality of the ingredients seems to be really good.  So if it actually tasted good I would have left 5 stars.

I bought this because the ingredients were quality compared to most whey proteins out there. I'm not one to care about taste so long as the nutrition is top tier, but this... this is by far the most bland tasting protein I've ever tried. Comparable to CVS brand protein. And it has this ability to counteract anything you add to it and just make it part of the blandness.I like Jocko.I love these ingredients.This tastes like dirt.

Molk is great! I have to say I really like the overall profile of this protein, I think they really took things down to a granular level and tried to develop a protein that not only is a good protein profile but also to provide you with nutrients and different items that will help with the absorption of the proteins.Now if all you care about is that big number in grams of protein, this might not be the best product for you. If you’re looking for a well rounded protein that will help to curb appetite that will help with absorption that will help you help you be your best self I think that this is the protein.The profile is definitely there, I can agree that 22 g for the premium price when looking at a protein powder is a little on the low end. I would not object to them upping that number. At the same time I understand that the price comes in when you look at the rest of the goodies like probiotics.

I was skeptical to try this protein after initially trying the Jocko Go RTD drinks.I’m glad I found this protein tho. I have drank protein for the past 5 years. Other protein powders are over bearing with sweetness. Molk has a great flavor with the too sweet flavor. Also blends well and has probiotics so I don’t get no bloating after drinking this. Will continuously buy. ***Mixing w/ almond milk***

I LOVE THIS!About me: I have a really high metabolism.  I have an ectomorphic body type, so I generally burn more calories sitting down than some people do working out.  When I work out, I have a hard time gaining weight.  In college, the football coach suggested I increase my caloric intake to double the normal daily recommended amount, so I would just eat like crazy.  I was finishing each day with an entire pint of Ben n Jerry's ice cream.  I was maintaining weight while working out twice a day, but I was not gaining weight.I'm older now, and work out less (still do jiu jitsu, run, and lift), and I actually lose weight if I work out a lot because I cannot eat as much as I once did, mostly due to time.  I tried a few protein shakes (Muscle Milk, MetRx, Sun Warrior, etc.) to see if they made a difference, and while they would quell hunger at night, I was still losing weight, and worse yet, some had weird side effects thanks to additives or ingredients.  Muscle Milk made me feel jittery and MetRx made me incredibly thirsty for hours (I believe it's because MetRx is made with aspertame).  Sun Warrior just didn't work for me, and it was expensive.  Eventually, I decided to just not work out heavily and avoid excessive cardio to avoid losing weight.Enter MOLK: I've been drinking this mixed with 8 ounces Strauss Milk.  It tastes like chocolate milk.  It mixes easily in just a blender bottle, too.  Eating regularly, and taking Molk on workout days after working out, I've noticed that I'm actually gaining weight again!  A few months ago, I decided to go hard in the gym and start lifting heavy again.  Drinking Molk with milk after workouts and still eating regularly, I am able to gain weight (adding muscle mass), and I'm not waking up hungry in the middle of the night.I highly recommend Molk.  It's the best protein supplement I've ever had.

Im a big fan of jocko's books, podcasts, etc so i bought into buying his supplement product. I got the chocolate molk and honestly nothing special about it. The flavor is decent, about the same as any other chocolate protein you'd buy. didn't notice any time recovery benefits that are different from other leading products. Also, beware of the marketing scheme this company and many other protein suppliers use, this bottle is less than half filled up, so you are buying a bottle that is about 40% filled up, maybe even that. This is pretty disappointing since you hear him say how his stuff is better than(competitor name) and then you get the same stuff as you get anywhere else lol. Not a terrible product but you can find better stuff elsewhere

There are enough meme reviews, so I'll give a more straightforward take.  So far I've tried chocolate mint, vanilla, and pumpkin.  My usual method is to blend in a shaker bottle and around half the time blend with ice.  When it is blended I make the pre mix as concentrated as possible.Pros1.  Best tasting protein I've ever had.  Chocolate mint is my favorite, but vanilla has been nice as well.  I started adding some cold brew coffee to the vanilla shakes and it really is a dessert.  I half way wanted to make another shake just for the taste even though I didn't need it.2.  Mixes very well.  I have a hard time comparing this to too many other proteins because I only recently started using shaker bottles.  The only other protein I've tried with the shaker is Primal Fuel which is also great, but doesn't mix very well at all.3.  No BS.  There is no proprietary blend full of God knows what, no BCAAs, no glutamine, creatine etc.  Just what is on the boxCons1.  It is 100% whey concentrate.  No whey isolate to be found.  Not the biggest of deals, plus the cheaper ones are probably 90%+ concentrate anyway.  They just have isolate on their ingredients just to say that they have some.2.  The price point is a bit on the high side.  Both Molk and 6 Star 660g of protein per container and 6 Star is $18-$20.  Then again it is another one of those get what you pay for type of things.  6 Star is the Wal-Mart brand for a reason.  Molk is more competition with Legion.  Legion is great for only having Isolate, but they sweeten with stevia so it doesn't taste as good.

On one of his podcasts he compared this flavor to a mint chocolate chip milkshake.. I mix this with milk and it doesn't even come close to that. That said, high quality ingredients and made in America so I like that. Price is on par with other high quality supplements, but the flavor is nothing like what you get with a product like Syntha-6 from BSN or Optimum Nutrition flavors.

It will all boil down to how important taste is for you, and if you like the taste of monk fruit or not.I for one don't mind the taste of monk fruit, and I still think the taste is mediocre. That's not to say it's bad! There are just much better tasting ones out there, and if monk fruit taste bitter to you like a friend of mine, you are really going to dislike this.From the research I've done, the price is pretty comfortable with other high in protein products. Truth is, they'll probably taste better than this. But I'm not looking for dessert, I'm looking for high-quality, clean protein. That's why I will continue to buy this brand. My best advice is try to get a sample of it before you commit to purchase.

A solid Eh+.  The flavor is nice, the macros are fine, it just doesn't mix great.  I just feel like I'm just drinking a slightly inferior product. I'm going to finish the bottle, I'm just not going to buy it again. With so many products on the market, Jocko just seems like a 2nd/3rd tier one.  If it works for you, cool, if it fits your price range, cool, I don't regret trying it out, this is just not a protein I'm enthusiastic about in any way.  It comes out kind of grainy and chunky when mixed with milk and I haven't noticed any significant accelerations in my gains over other proteins.  In summary, I don't have a lot of negative things to say about it, I just don't have any positive things to say about it either.I've tried a lot of proteins in my career as a personal trainer, and I'd give this a solid Eh+.

I've tried just about every flavor, the only one that isn't fantastic to me is Pumpkin and that turns out is best as a hot drink.Use any milk or non milk milk for a GOOD outcome. Use water if you have to, just know you are getting a ham sandwich.The Bad reviews need to improve on their ownership skills. If it tastes watery don't use water, if you want it hot mix it GOOD or add it to hot liquid, people looking for a free meal leave 1 star. Man if it doesn't taste good say its just not for you. If the portion seems off, its to keep the powder from jumping when you scoop it because the particles are so light and fluffy. Get Some or Get over

*Pure monk fruit (no added sweeteners!)*No sugar*Probiotics*Basic natural ingredients*22 grams protein per scoopJocko is the man! I recently got off artificial sweeteners and did not want a sugar filled protein powder. I'm also allergic to stevia, so to say it was hard to find a protein powder is an understatement! Although, not as sweet as other powders that use sugar and sweeteners, Molk uses pure monk fruit and does not add artificial sweeteners or sugar like most monk fruit products. Monk fruit is extremely beneficial and healthy and has zero calories and will not spike your glucose levels. I recommend mixing this with 8oz of unsweetened vanilla almond milk for a great low calorie, sugar free shake. I use a ninja nutri blender and never have chunkiness or powdery residue.

I've tried all the flavors other than chocolate. I'm a fan, they mix well (chocolate mint didn't mix as well as the others) and have a good flavor. Here is how I would rank them starting with the least favorite- 1. chocolate mint, 2. vanilla gorilla, 3. banana creme bomber, 4. chocolate peanut butter, 5.strawberry. Note I am not a chocolate fan, but love peanutbutter. The strawberry is dessert without being too rich (I've tried other brands that were way too rich). I've tried them with whole milk but prefer water for personal dietary reasons (high protein low carb for years). I've also noticed some other brands advertise a higher protein amount per serving but then you notice the serving is two scoops (molk is one scoop), don't fall for it, get you some molk, stay the path!

Update June 27, 2022: Banana revelation....Ive been drinking molk for a few years now. Still the best protein powder Ive found. Better than ALL the other brands Ive tried. Tastes great and easy to digest. The chocolate flavor was, until recently, my go to. Great tatse. (I mix it with almond milk.) The peanut butter chocolate used to pretty close second for me in terms of favorite flavor. But now Ive tried banana....and oh my gosh....just try it. Its awesome. Easily my new favorite flavor!When I first heard of Mölk, I was looking for a top quality protein that is effective, easily digestible, and doesn't taste like I licked a dirty blackboard. (Don't ask. All I'll say is that elementary school wasn't exactly the most obedient, trouble-free time in life. And I had some inventive teachers.)I bought the chocolate flavor. In short, I love this stuff. It's my go to protein supplement. The chocolate milk I gave up when I decided to get truly disciplined about my diet and lifting/running/doing functional fitness workouts 5-6 days a week has been replaced by mölk and almond milk. The combination is delightful. Also, if you freeze mölk with whipping cream, it makes a wonderful ice cream-like treat. Soooooo good. Especially if you add a little butter to the mix. And I don't even like ice cream! Some reviewers have mentioned a slightly odd, almost artificial sweetener like after taste. I noticed absolutely zero of that. It tastes like a chocolate milkshake to me.Mölk lives up to it's excellent reputation in every regard. It's a great source of both whey and casein proteins (fast and slow release.) Tastes great and is easy on the stomach. It's well worth the price...in fact it's rather inexpensive when you consider the quality of product you're getting.  After 35 years of being a serious hobbyist athlete, I've tried nearly every type of protein supplement on the market. Mölk is without equal. Buy it. Try it. You'll love it too.

Recently, I purchased the Mint Chocolate flavored Mölk. I have been searching for a protein mix that is made naturally and does not contain sugar filled lies. If you are an average joe who likes to get after it, a young whippersnapper in a high school lifting program, a soccer mom who drinks breakfast shakes, or a barrel-chested beast at the gym, Mölk is for you. In the past, like thousands of others, I have used a wide variety of different protein blends that always seem to be too expensive, do not mix well, and taste like teacher chalk.  However, Mölk offers a perfect combination beneficial functionality, fast delivery time, and affordable price.Mölk contains an exceptional balance of flavor that does not leave me with cravings after it is gone. The Mint Chocolate flavor is not overpowering and it tastes GOOD. Normally, I drink Mölk in the mornings with breakfast, and once after my workout. Unlike other brands, it does not clump together when you mix it in a shaker bottle with milk. I was blown away by how well it mixed and how smooth it went down.  Additionally, Mölk is a powerful combination protein, probiotics, and vitamins that give you a supernatural recovery. The best aspect of Mölk is that it does not contain any sugars. Rather, all the flavor is created from all natural sources. Mölk has an incredible taste no matter how you blend it.After ordering Mölk, I was impressed by the speed that it arrived at my door. With impeccable timing, it was waiting on my front step when I returned home from the gym just a few days after placing my order. After indulging it for the first time, I was automatically able to dead lift 1,000 lbs. If you are looking for a product that maximizes swollness, this is for you.  Overall, I would recommend Mölk to anyone I care about. It is in the middle of the spectrum as far as price goes, but it is absolutely worth it. GET SOME.

I've been looking for a non-sugary, non-gross, non-chemical-laden chocolate flavoured protein powder for my AM Ritual for a long, long time and hadn't hit many results. I don't do well with Stevia (headaches, dizziness) or most sugar substitutes - but at the same time, I also don't want to be drinking 16g of Sugar in the morning or even worse, corn syrup.I chose this because of the grass-fed whey and because of the monk fruit extract (which doesn't cause me any funky side effects). I'm also allergic to soy, and the no-soy promise was another major reason for purchase.In all honesty, I didn't have high hopes. I just assumed I'd be disappointed, either the flavour would be way off or it wouldn't mix well, or I'd feel horrible afterwards.This morning, I threw together my almond milk and the Chocolate Jocko Mölk into my blender bottle, and drank up. It was amazing. Dissolved easily. Didn't take OVERLY overly like a chocolate syrup, but, definitely tasted like chocolate, and no freaky after effects. Awesome.The only thing is the container is massive - waaay larger than I was expecting, so that'll take up some counter/closet space, but, totally worth it.

Typical Jocko product in that it is clean, simple, and effective. A bit pricey compared to other powders I've used, but found it to be worth it for the ingredients and taste alone. Never had any upset stomach issues with this as I've had with some of the off the shelf stuff at Vitamin Shop or GNC and as far as vanilla flavored protein mix goes, this was the one with the least sweet/oppressive taste that I've had, which is good for me since I tend to mix with all kinds of different fruit and veggie blends and I don't want the protein overpowering the other flavors. Also seems to blend a bit easier/smoother so you don't get those ""chunks"" in your shake.

The perfect way to drink this is with oat milk, no ice. Weird - I know. I experimented with ice and oat milk (usual go-to) but this seems to be better with just the oat milk. I like to use a smaller oat milk to protein powder ratio.Huge Jocko fan, and was driven to Amazon after learning he had his own protein, Molk, amongst products. Apparently I've been living under a rock. That being said, I've tried what feels like ever protein under the sun - Tera's Whey, Orgain, Vega, Nuzest, Garden of Life, to name a few.I ordered the Chocolate Peanut Butter only because the Chocolate Mint wasn't available via Prime*. Personally, not a big chocolate fan, or peanut butter fan, but am a big ""peanut butter and chocolate"" fan than chocolate alone, thus, here we are.Mixed 1 scoop of the protein with a handful of ice, some oat milk, 1 tbs ground flax seeds and some water.Verdict: not as dense and chocolate-ey as I thought it would be, which is, personally, nice. It's actually a very light flavor profile, so if you're expecting a huge chocolate kick - maybe try the plain ""chocolate"" flavor instead. The peanut butter is subtle too.Blended very easily, felt good after consumption, and cleaner ingredients than many others on the market.Will repeat purchase - this time, trying the mint.Wish it had less sugar (has 2g) - but I don't particularly see the need for this one to have 2g, while the mint has 1g.Photos uploaded indicate the amount that came on the bottle - seems like a standard amount, standard scoop.

I have tried nine different protein powders over the years. Some good and some bad. For me personally, this is the best protein I’ve ever used. What I love about this protein is that it substantially thickens your drink which helps me a lot because I drink it with UNSWEETENED almond milk (Simply Almond, best brand). It’s closer to the dark chocolate side and with the thickening of the drink, it doesn’t have that super watery feel. However, if you’re looking for the tastiest protein of your life, not sure this is it; it does taste decent though. The ingredients and benefits are what’s most important. This stuff gives 22g protein which may not be as high as some other competitors but here’s the thing, it has digestive enzymes, infused probiotics and NO Gluten or SOY which is huge in my opinion. All of this together with the value and manliness, it’s your best choice especially if you’re new to fitness. Highly recommend!

I've been using protein from Costco for years now (because, you know, they have good deals on bulk items). Any how, I decided to give the MÖLK train a try. I jumped on the interwebs and order that mint chocolate MÖLK. In the meantime, while I was waiting for my MÖLK to arrive, I ran out of ""the other guy's protein,"" so the need for protein started to get real. Needless to say, when the MÖLK finally arrived, I couldn't wait to try it after my deadlift workout the next morning. After deadlifting 315 lbs (I haven't tried Jocko DISCIPLINE yet, so I'm short of the 8000 lb deadlift), I came home and ripped open the MÖLK! Cracked open the milk! Then the smell of sour milk sent my olfactory nerves into a flurry of sadness. After much contemplation, I said to that sour milk, ""stand by to get some!"" And jack hammered that MÖLK right into its soul! Long story short, the amount of American patriotism that is contained in every scoop MÖLK was enough to cancel...nay...OBLITERATE the taste of sour communism right out of that sour milk. I was astonished! I immediately ran to the grocery store to buy new milk just to see how the pure majestic glory of the mint chocolate MÖLK was suppose to taste. I was not disappointed. You may now catch me riding the tasty goodness of the MÖLK train to the end of time. Thank you, Jocko. Thank you, Origin and thank you, Nate Dawg for providing the goods!

I’ve mixed this with water and it’s good. Mixing it with milk is awesome. I did one scoop to 6oz and it was think and taste. Almost like thin pudding. With 8oz was really good and easily drinkable. This was my first type of protein drink. I’ve listened to the show for a few years now and it’s nice to support Jocko. I’m not a health nut. I drink one of these instead of a Mountain Dew.

So I ordered this, excited to have found a grass-fed protein powder in one of my favorite flavors (mint chocolate), and the included digestive enzymes and probiotics were just the cherry on top. The ingredient quality is all there – but there are a few critical things that bummed me out about this protein powder:When blending this with your liquid of choice, you'll need a minimum ratio of 1 scoop to 8oz of liquid. I like to make my protein shakes with ~10oz of almond milk with 2 scoops of protein powder, but with this one, it just wouldn't blend properly. I realize that the instructions suggest 10oz of liquid for each scoop (I think), but even when I didn't add it all at once, a lot of the powder still coagulated. Maybe it was just because the almond milk I blended it with was cold, or perhaps it was just some of the ingredients in this powder. However, I am able to blend it with great vigor.The flavor I got was Mint Chocolate, and it wasn't very good, rather earthy in taste. Not undrinkable, but certainly nothing to look forward to; it definitely felt like I was only consuming it for the properties. This is a supplement, after all, but many other protein powders have a taste well enough to offer a pleasant experience that adds to the supplementing. Again, the taste could have been affected by the other ingredients found here, or perhaps Mint Chocolate was the wrong flavor.

Look I don't think Jocko's trying to compete w/ the big boys so you have to take this stuff for what he's willing to put on the label.  That said this is probably more of a $29 can of protein than it is $45.  But I'm always out for something new, especially good flavors and I can mix them; ie, strawberry + banana.  I've tried peanut butter, banana, chocolate mint, and strawberry.  My number one complaint: you can taste they whey more than you can the actual flavor.  I remember when Jocko first started promoting this and relayed how his friends were blown away by the taste.  Sorry not the case folks.  A bit disappointing especially coming from someone like Jokco.  Flavor needs to be increased by at least 25%; if not 50%.

Ok lets get the negatives out of the way. It's expensive and it's an arm workout to mix in a shaker without having clumps. Now that we've established that.... Mixed with milk this is really awesome! Tastes better than even my previous taste favorite from Optimum Nutrition. It has a delayed slightly chalky aftertaste but no big deal. With water it basically tastes like a watered down Muscle Milk so stick with some milk or almond milk. I don't know how to pronounce half the amino acids but I suppose that's probably a good thing. I recommend it. As Jocko says, standby to get some.Follow up: definitely use in milk if using a shaker. Much better at dissolving that way. Results... Muscle mass improved....in fact I've gained 7 lbs. My wife has noticed more bulk on me. Just some side effects to be aware of. Had almost what I would describe as moon-face for awhile like when you are on a steroid. Went away. Also acne has been a bit of a side effect, but I know some of the amino acids in this are known to cause that. I still like it. I like the taste....I like the recovery....I like the improved results over my old protein.

So the flavors are great. No doubt about that. Probably the best I have had with the more “natural” ingredient protein powders. Here is THE issue. So the Jocko brand really pushes made in the USA with most if not all of his products. That’s why I don’t understand it states “MADE IN THE USA” very large on this product and underneath in small lettering with domestic and global ingredients. That means in theory that whey could be imported from China or anywhere else. I reached out to origin labs to find out which countries they will source ingredients from and they came back with it’s basically a secret. So with all of that being said, there are many,many,many protein powders out there that have no problem sourcing USA ingredients. For a company like Jocko/Origin to tout made in the USA on everything and not make it a point to AT LEAST source US ingredients like it’s impossible or something is ridiculous.

I’ve ordered this product about three times now so I feel fairly comfortable writing a review for it.  I’ve consistently purchased the chocolate peanut butter flavor so that’s the only experience I have. With that being said...Flavor: Tastes just okay with water. Use milk instead and it’s very good. Add in a tablespoon of peanut butter and it’s delicious.Digestability: For the most part I haven’t had any issues. There have been a few times that if I take it right before bed, I wake up with terrible protein farts. Otherwise, if taken during the day, no problems.Price: it’s expensive when you factor in shipping. I’m really crossing my fingers that it eventually becomes prime eligible.Quality: here’s where I factor in my five star review. I’m not a sports nutritionist so I won’t pretend to know more than I do about protein,  but from the little I do know I can tell this is a product made with quality ingredients. No fillers or other BS. I’ll be honest and say that the biggest reason I buy this product is because I trust Jocko and his integrity.  If he’s willing to put his name on a product, I’m trusting it’s quality and legitimacy. This factor alone makes up for the expensive pricing. You get what you pay for.Conclusion: Expensive pricing, decent flavor, good digestability, excellent quality.  Quality makes up for pricing.  If this was prime eligible it would make the product perfect.

I'm a huge fan of the JOCK MOLK product. I will say I'm a little concerned about processing quality however. I've ordered 4 containers over the past six months, and the third came with a completely different product inside the container. Both the consistency of the powder and the way it mixed in to liquid were different from previous and following purchases. Hopefully this is a one time issue and not a consistent.

The first shake I made was with water, and the taste wasn't anything special, but since then I have been mixing in a blender bottle with milk and I now look forward to my Molk every morning!  I would say that the chocolate flavor ""The Darkness"", when mixed with milk, tastes almost like a drinkable frosty from Wendy's. Molk is not overly sweet like other protein shakes, and it is not gritty.My wife and I have been using Molk now for over a week, and we both are very happy with it. I also bought the chocolate Warrior Kid Molk for my 4 year old daughter, she loves it and wants to workout with me every evening.Because Molk is more expensive than other protein shakes, I suggested to my wife that we buy a 6 lb. bag of a different protein for roughly the same price of the 2 lb. tub of Molk, and my wife said no because she appreciates the ingredients in Molk and it doesn't have the weird fake sugar after taste that other protein shakes do. Molk has probiotics, and digestive enzymes that other proteins do not, so I am killing a couple birds with ones stone in a way.Conclusion:Molk is GOOD!Molk is very healthy!Molk mixes smooth, and we like it with milk, almond milk, and water when we are out of milk.We will buy Molk again.

I should start by saying that I value my time and tend to go the path of least time-commitment when it comes to eating.  Enter the BlenderBottle Classic Loop Top Shaker.  It’s not the easiest lid to pop shut, so make sure you really push down until it’s closed.  Otherwise you’ll be cleaning up a big ol’ mess.  Assuming you can do that part right, it does the job of blending protein drinks perfectly.  That brings us to parts two and three; Chocolate-flavored Molk from Jocko and Four Sigmatic with Lion’s Mane.  I’ve had a couple runs (13+ miles) where I’ve capped it off with the protein powder coupled with the instant coffee over water.  What a perfect combo!  I tried the protein powder by itself with water and it was missing something.  I didn’t want to go with milk, so instead I grabbed the coffee out of the pantry.  Usually runs of this distance in July and August will leave me drained for hours and in need of a nap but grabbing some fast protein and a smidge of smart caffeine takes away all the usual post-run drag.  If you’re looking for a way to liven up your post-run mornings/afternoons, this is the way to go.

Molk takes pretty good. That may sound like a lukewarm review, but ""pretty good"" in the context of protein powder is a great review. I have my own recipe for my protein shakes and the taste of many protein powders must be overpowered by other ingredients to make a decent shake. That isn't the case with Molk. Molk by itself tastes pretty good. When I combined it with my other typical ingredients, it shined way past other protein powders. My protein shakes made with Molk tastes so good I have to force myself not to make another one right away.In case you are wondering, here is my protein shake recipe (for chocolate lovers):1 1/3 cup chocolate almond milk (100 cals per cup)2 tables spoons of peanut butter powder2 scoops Molk2-3 cups of iceYou will need a decent blender to properly chop the ice.

I have a lot of respect for Jocko and have tried his other products, which is why I decided to give this one a try. This is pne of the best tasting proteins I've tried. And it's keto-friendly! No disgusting stevia here, no other ingredients to contribute to a funky taste or smell. Just good ol' chocolate flavor.

You don’t always get what you order. It’s happened to me twice now where I ordered chocolate peanut butter(which taste amazing) and they send me dark chocolate (which taste not half as good). On the positive, Product is made with quality ingredients and peanut butter taste amazing.

Believe me when I say that I bought, not just one, but two flavors from Levels grass-fed whey protein with very high hopes after having watched several review videos on YouTube regarding their superiority over every other brand of whey protein providers out in the market as of now. I really went into it with an open mind. I mean, I really, really tried to literally last as long as I possibly could. I really wanted to like this, but I couldn't tolerate it any longer.Now, allow me to explain that scientifically, considering all the nutritive aspects of this brand of whey protein, it's as good as any other quality brand, such as Optimum Nutrition or PEScience. I have never felt or noticed any type of negative results from using Levels. Nevertheless, the problem lies in their flavors, which are absolutely unpalatable, which makes them completely undrinkable. Therefore, if a certain whey protein is excellent scientifically speaking, yet its flavor is horrendous, what good is it to a person trying to drink it as a post-workout recovery nutritional supplement? It's utterly worthless at that point. So much for the superior taste that Levels claims to have because of their exclusively grass-fed cows from which their whey protein is derived. Also noteworthy is that their powders never seem to mix very well when compared to the other two aforementioned brands. There are always huge lumps of the powder that just can’t seem to dissolve and mix into the water. I know that cold water does make mixing a bit more difficult, but I’ve never had a problem with Optimum Nutrition or PEScience. Both of them mix in perfectly when shaken by hand in a tumbler.As I have stated, scientifically speaking, the Levels brand of whey protein is just as good as any other quality brand of whey protein. They all contain, more or less, very similar ingredients and very similar proportions of each ingredient. For example, Levels contains 5.4 grams of BCAA’s (Branched Chain Amino Acids) per serving (per scoop), whereas Optimum Nutrition contains 5.5 grams of BCAA’s per serving. As for the specific list of BCAA’s that each brand utilizes, Levels lists them specifically on their packaging, whereas Optimum Nutrition does not (they have actually preferred to maintain that list under secrecy), which might be some cause for concern for some people. Nevertheless, Optimum Nutrition does state on their packaging that all of their ingredients have been tested and approved to be come from clean sources, which is not the case with Levels, as I’ve noticed from a couple of reviews from auto-immunodeficient users who have had flare-ups after using Levels. This is very unfortunate and sad.Continuing with the very similar types of ingredients, it’s very important that whatever whey protein one is purchasing also contain BCAA’s, since they’re interrelated. Now, it isn’t necessary for whey protein powders to also contain BCAA’s, but they would help post-workout recovery all the more. They would especially help if the person were to workout while in a fasted state (not having eating anything prior to the workout). The reason that whey proteins don’t need BCAA’s is that whey proteins, as do all proteins, are already made up of many types of amino acids. Amino acids, as one might remember, are vital for the everyday functionality of our muscles. They’re literally the powerhouse or powder keg fuel of our muscles in their everyday functions. However, BCAA’s tend to specifically help our muscles better cope with the microtears and any other byproducts directly related to strain they’ve endured when working out, such as muscle soreness and feeling excessively tired. Therefore, my reason for saying that it’s extremely important for whey proteins to also include BCAA’s is that you’ll essentially be drinking a far more effective post-workout recovery drink. Although, beginners might not feel the difference as opposed to a more seasoned health enthusiast.The Vanilla Bean flavor was my second and very last flavor from Levels. I had previously bought a 2-lb tub of the Capuccino flavor, but it was impossible to drink even two scoops of it dissolved in 16 oz of cold water. I realize that any whey protein powder will taste much better with milk, for example, but any whey protein should taste just fine, even great, with only water, if one should so choose to drink it (I choose to drink my shakes with only water to avoid any excess or unnecessary calories, since I'm already rather heavyset and am really trying to lose weight; this also leaves out any unforeseen problems with lactose.). Unlike Levels, that's exactly what PEScience and Optimum Nutrition have proven, especially PEScience. Nearly all of their flavors are spot on, super delicious.Unfortunately, that's the not case with Levels. Their Vanilla Bean flavor tastes so nasty and disgusting, almost like some type of weird milk that's very close to spoiling. The only thought that comes to mind for comparison was the bluish milk that Luke Skywalker obtains from the alien cows in Star Wars: The Last Jedi and drinks with a grin on his face. That alone was a nasty picture, but that's exactly what I kept thinking about when I tried drinking this. Of course, this powder isn't blue, but the flavor was enough to trigger that movie scene playing out in my head.As for the Capuccino flavor tub, I had bought it back in early September 2022. I don't know how I mustered the courage, but I had brought it down to about an eighth of the tub within 7 long, torturous months of having purchased it. I finally decided to end my torture and end my affiliation with Levels permanently about two weeks ago. I threw out both flavors. The Vanilla Bean flavor was only a 1-lb bag, but I couldn't endure more than three or four 16-oz shakes. For those wondering, the Capuccino flavor tasted more like a rancid cup of caramel iced coffee or something like that. Totally nasty!As I had mentioned earlier, I choose to mix in whey protein in nothing but cold water because I’m currently engaged in a long, arduous, gradual fight to lose a significant amount of weight. Using only water is merely an extension of restricting calories and choosing healthy food, which is a full-time process. I cycle 15.7 miles three to four times a week and have lost nearly 75 lbs in 20 months. It isn’t easy, but it’s definitely worth the effort. When the results begin to show, it’s an awesome feeling, and one can only ponder on all the sweat, pain, and patience that one had to endure and utilize to achieve them.I recommend trying PEScience and Optimum Nutrition instead of this garbage. I have tried Optimum Nutrition’s French Vanilla Crème, Chocolate Malt, Chocolate Peanut Butter, and Vanilla Ice Cream. Chocolate Peanut Butter was way too sweet and had way too much chocolate and nowhere nearly enough peanut butter flavor, so I didn’t like it. Vanilla Ice Cream was good, but the flavor wasn’t complex enough, which made it very easy to get tired of it, and that’s exactly what happened. However, both French Vanilla Crème and Chocolate Malt are totally awesome, especially the former, which mixes great and goes down very smoothly.I, then, tried PEScience’s Amazing Peanut Butter Cookie, Amazing Strawberry Cheesecake, Amazing Cookies & Cream, Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup, and Amazing Gourmet Vanilla. The last two weren’t horrible. In fact, they were actually rather good, but they weren’t awesome. All the other ones, however, are excellent! I’m also planning on trying their Café Series Vanilla Sweet Cream and Iced Mocha flavors.I had begun using whey protein about a year ago when my workouts started weighing down on my daily performance. I started feeling excessively tired and extremely sore. That alone made me realize that I needed a supplement to help counter those effects. I had been working out for about six months. I felt almost immediate relief after taking Quest Vanilla Milk Shake whey protein. It seemed to work fine, but that flavor just wasn’t all that complex and was way too sweet, so when I finished it, I switched to Optimum Nutrition’s Vanilla Ice Cream. While that one wasn’t all that great, I stuck with Optimum Nutrition because, as I stated earlier, they do claim that their ingredients are clean-sourced. I eventually did find two of their flavors that I really like: French Vanilla Crème and Chocolate Malt. PEScience is another one with awesome flavors. Another reason for sticking with Optimum Nutrition and PEScience is that they also seem to work far better than Quest ever did. Do yourself a favor and try those instead. Avoid Levels completely. Do not buy their rancid products. You’ll be much happier, trust me.Although, go ahead and try them out. You might actually like their flavors. The way I see it, the drinkability of a product is extremely important, and from what I’ve seen, that’s not what Levels is concerned with. I give these products 1 star, but I would give zero stars if that were possible.

I've been using this product for a few years now. I love how easily it mixes with a magic bullet (probably anything would really with it). I never use a shaker bottle so I can't speak to how it would mix that way. The flavor of the mocha is good and not too overpowering as I don't drink coffee. Their regular chocolate is too sweet or something so I definitely prefer the mocha.The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5-stars is that I used to pay A LOT less for this stuff. I know inflation is high, among other economic factors for everything being so expensive these days, but man the price really went up on this compared to what I paid before.

Finally made it back into the gym after all the pandemic closures and hiccups, having lost most of my pre-pandemic musculature. Started using this and was back into form in about 3 weeks. I lift heavy and before with other protein products I would still have little injuries all the time. With Levels my recovery time is phenomenal, and I experience very few aches and pains even at age 56. Now I'm in better shape and stronger than I have ever been. Last week I ran out of Levels and had to go a day and a half without it until my next subscribe and save shipment rolled in. I didn't think it would make any difference - wrong! My left hand was hurting and I didn't want to equate it to not having Levels, but as soon as I got back on it everything went back to good. I eat plenty of other sources of protein, but this is the premium stuff - it just works!

As of Jan/Feb 2023: It’s a little tricky how it said “Grass Fed 100% Whey”. You might accidentally read that as “100% Grass Fed Whey”. I think that’s a bit of a cheap trick but maybe I’m too harsh. I really wanted this to be 100% GF and it would be perfect/ would have been a 5 star. The product label used to say “100% grass fed” so why the change Levels? I’d like to hear their response… Other than that, the taste (for Vanilla at least) was great and comparable to other brands (like Optimum Nutrition which uses fake flavors/sweeteners) but maintained a much healthier ingredient listing and nothing fake. I definitely recommend. Mixed pretty well too.

Let me start off by saying that this year is my first year venturing into the world of protein powder. I recently joined a gym that involves a lot of cardio and weight training. This gym sells their own brand of protein powder, which I purchased, along with this brand. The levels protein powder mix is silky-smooth every single time with my blender bottle. The other brand remains clumpy, even after vigorous shaking. I just bought the regular vanilla bean flavored and it taste great. I also feel like it settles better with my stomach than the other brand. I will be buying this again! Sidenote, since beginning at the gym, I have already lost inches, and my trainers attribute it to increasing my protein intake and building muscle.

I've been trying to find new flavors for my daily protein shakes and came across these and the awesome reviews. This product did not disappoint!! The cappuccino flavor literally tastes like iced coffee. It's not even thick like a normal protein shake! The cappuccino one went down way too fast, it was so delicious! The vanilla cinnamon tastes just like a Chai latte to me. They both blend so well, do not thicken, have an incredible flavor. And then the fact that it's all hormone free and grass fed...you can taste that you're getting the good stuff. And at the decent price of similar brands in stores ($20 per pound) I found my forever protein powder!! I can't wait to try the other flavors Levels has to offer.

I'm 32 and have been lifting and consuming protein since I was in high school. The predominate brand I've always stuck with is ON. I've branched out from time to time (Muscle Milk, Myoplex, MusclePharm, and even Ghost more recently), but I always landed back at ON because of whey quality and availability. I'm a nerd by trade (Navy Nuke with a MS in ME) and have always been more into reading medical journal articles, and published papers on the latest and greatest science/engineering than video games or TV. Bottom line, while I've always ""treated"" my body like a temple, I haven't focused too much on my protein until recently. This set me out to find a cleaner Protein with less impact on my gut biome. While ON offers a clean version of their protein, it still has a bit more to it than this or Naked.I tried Naked first, and found the flavor lacking. Additionally as an individual who others are intolerant of me consuming lactose, Naked caused my guts and other areas to bubble. So my next try was Level, and boy am I glad I did. Great price (look at the servings)! Incredible taste (vanilla cinnamon)! And so clean...no gas after a week of eating it twice a day.Unless the price increases > ON's clean version, I won't be going back!

I'm 52 and I've been a gym rat for 37 years.  This is the best protein I've ever tried.  I could tell a difference in my recovery times about a week into taking this.  I've tried most all of the big name brands and although they do an ok job, Levels seems to me to be better.  I've never cared about the taste of protein powder, because I take it to grow and not to enjoy.  Levels actually tastes good.  It doesn't mix quite as well as others, but that isn't an issue to me.  Until something better comes along, this is my brand.

I am in the military full time and I am also certified as a personal trainer, so I have probably tried every protein powder on the market at least once! This is easily the best whey protein supplement I've ever tried. Clean ingredients, and absolutely amazing taste! It is SO HARD to find a whey protein powder that doesn't require a dozen different kinds of artificial sweeteners to taste good. Levels really hit the nail on the head with this product. I have consistently been taking this as a post workout for several months now, and will continue to do so from here on out. My favorite flavor is cappuccino; literally tastes like I'm having a delicious coffee after my workouts. HIGHLY reccomend!

So I just finished with the last flavor of this otherwise stellar protein supplement. Correction, I have yet to try the cinnamon one, which will be in my next order. Levels has the second highest bioavailability of all the protein concentrate products I have tried in the past 15 years or so (roughly 2 dozen brands/products), based on how my body reacts to it, and it's reasonable, price-wise. (Hey Levels, don't get it into your head though; just keep everything as it is, and you have a returning costumer).I'm very discriminating when it comes to nutrition. My whey supplement must not contain artificial ingredients and/or fillers. (Also, I think Levels is cold-pressed, to boot, isn't it?)Regarding the flavors though, I'm sticking with the Peanut butter, Chocolate and Double Chocolate triumvirate. The Strawberry was fun to try once, and the ""Cold brew"" I would only suggest to the most adventurous contestants. The tester fella at the marketing dep. must have had his taste buds removed on this one, I reckon.Aside from that, it is a very solid offer and I'm sticking with it. Mind you, I'm not a casual consumer of protein powders but a heavy daily user, so, when I find a product that was made with natural ingredients, tastes well, and my body loves it, I'm keeping it. Highly recommended!I almost forgot, b/c it is not an important part to me at all, but the blending ability of this powder is overall good. But, again, I do not care, as long as it is beneficial to me to be consumed. I used to put a whole can of tuna into my shakes and machine blended them all together for extra protein, so the texture is tertiary to me, at best. Give it a shot! (I mean to Levels protein supplements :))

As a competitive powerlifter and current PhD student, the quality of my protein powder has become of utmost importance to me, both in meeting my macros/calories each day and as a supplement when meat is expensive or I don’t have time to cook.I have tried at least a dozen or so protein powders over the last decade and I have finally found the brand that I will stick with for as long as it is available. The price is EXCEPTIONAL for this high of quality protein powder (mixes great, tastes great, ingredients are great, company transparency is great, amino acid profile is great). I highly recommend this protein to anyone who needs to get more protein in their diet for whatever reason. If you’re curious, I tried the vanilla cinnamon and it’s great.I have probably spent thousands on protein powders (both the expensive, brand-name, fitness influencer discount coded stuff, and the off brand doodoo that tastes like chalk or makes you want to vomit). I even switched to unflavored now sports for a while because I couldn’t stand the horrible inconsistencies between brands. I’ll probably get some of this brand’s unflavored as well for cooking and such.As a final test, I also weighed out a level scoop and it ended up weighing exactly 32 g, just as the label says. I hate when the label lies, this one however, does not.Stop buying junk and stop paying too much for protein powder. This is the one you’ve been scrolling so long for, just try it and if you don’t like it, send it to me. If anything changes between now and my next few tubs, I will be updating my review. Thanks! Happy lifting and God bless ;)

I was looking for a flavored whey concentrate protein that would be low carb/high protein from grass fed cows and not taste too sweet (chocolate version) that doesn't break the bank. It's pretty much impossible to find a flavored grass fed protein that is not sickly sweet (American customer preference maybe?) This protein is made of US grass fed cows and contains stevia, monk fruit, and sunflower lecithin. Each serving has 3g carbs and 24g protein. There are 30 servings in the tub, which comes half filled (anyone know why the companies do this??)OVERALL: Best grass-fed/clean chocolate flavor whey concentrate given the carb/protein/non-sweet taste/price ratio.Downsides:- You don't know where the cows come from or if there are any quality certifications. I have had trouble with American processed milk and not European/Australian/NZ milk in the past. So if you've had trouble with American milk, please be aware that this brand advertises the milk as US sourced. If you want non-US grass fed milk, I have found that Antler farms has whey isolate from New Zealand and Protein Factory has  whey isolate and concentrate (non flavored) from New Zealand and Germany. These products look super clean and are on my list (they are also more expensive or unflavored, so I stared with this one). The Legion brand also has whey isolate from Irish grass fed cows, but the flavored versions contain more additives: maltodextrin, xantham gum, sunflower lecithin, stevia. I do not recommend the flavored Promix/Naked brands if you want to limit your sugar (see below.)YES, I HAVE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME RESEARCHING THIS.- This still has stevia and monk fruit as sweeteners. And sunflower lecithin. I wish it only had the cacao powder. As a result it tastes a bit like cheap milk chocolate (but anything is better than the tongue curdling sickly chemical sweetness of most other brands.)- Big tub. Can they please get rid of this? How bad is this for the planet, seriously. Grass fed cows and big plastic tubs!!! Siiiigh....Upsides:- It's low sugar. Each serving has only 3g carbs and 24g protein. The Naked/Promix brands have nearly 8g carbs/sugar from coconut sugar in each serving of their flavored varieties. The daily recommended intake of sugar for women is 25g, so you can do the math!- So far, no bloating or tummy issues.- Mixes well with plain water in a shaker bottle. Does not clump and it is not chalky. It is also not soapy.- Taste: it does not taste chemical and is also not very sweet at all, so you can mix this with other things like coffee or bananas. The stronger part of the taste is the ""cheap milk chocolate"" rather than the sweetness. So it just depends on what you like. Don't expect a creamy rich delish chocolate tasting shake! If you do, you will not like this. But I challenge you to find a chocolate flavored whey with all the other benefits. If you find it, please leave a comment, I would love to try it.

I've been working on upgrading my protein powder since I use it every day to increase my protein intake. After many tries, this is the best I've found. Clean ingredients, tastes good, no nasty aftertaste, blends well, and best of all, reasonably priced. I started with the double chocolate. I'm buying more and going to try the vanilla cinnamon too.

I have tried just about every protein powder there is. I eat clean and typically go for the cleanest possible powders, but usually they come with some kind of “yuck taste.” After reading some other paleo/clean eaters reviews and raves about this product I had to try it. Let me say, it did not disappoint! Flavor is great, ingredients are great, mixes well and no yucky taste! I’m so happy. I got the vanilla but will be trying some of the other flavors too now that I know it’s a quality product.

I usually don’t write reviews but actually care about nutrition since it’s a long term investment so here we go...ordered the levels whey protein, pure chocolate, due to the clean ingredients list.  Previously used less naked whey brand which is $1.12 an ounce which is pretty pricy.  This one comes in currently at 70 something cents an ounce which is a huge cost difference over time.  This one’s ingredients are whey protein, cocoa powder, sunflower lecithin, monk fruit extract, and stevia, so fairly clean.  PLEASE when you are looking for protein do your research on what to look for.  Both of these brands list out the amino acids found in each serving and, without getting too technical, seem to have pretty similar profiles.  Leucine is at a level I am happy with, and most brands don’t even list that out.  I won’t buy a protein that doesn’t list out the amino acid profile, because people could be putting crappy protein in there.Okay, now to taste.  This one really isn’t that bad.  It has a mild chocolate flavor so if you want something overpowering strong this probably isn’t the right fit.  But to me it has a “clean” taste.  Some people complain about the sweetness, but honestly you are going to get a different sweetness taste depending on what type of sweetener is used in the product.  This one uses monk fruit extract and stevia extract.  To me, the sweetness in this tastes just like stevia, including a slight aftertaste.  So if you don’t like the type of sweetness in a pack of stevia for your coffee, say, you probably won’t like the aftertaste of this. (If you are on the fence about it, go order a $1 coffee or tea and put a pack of stevia in it and see what you think!) The less naked whey for instance uses coconut sugar so avoids some of that aftertaste.  Honestly In my opinion the sweetness issue that people have mentioned is just a personal preference issue.I personally wish that the lecithin would have been left out, because that could cause some issues with bloating.  (I didn’t have any issues with bloating though!)Overall, I really like this protein! I have no major complaints.  In a world with no budget constraints I might go with something slightly more clean, but honestly it would still be a toss up and this one is a ton more affordable than some competitors.Hopefully this helps, let me know if I’m missing anything big!

SUUUUPER BLAND. Probably the blandest tasting protein powder I've ever tasted. I got the cappuccino flavor and it tastes like you are drinking water in a cup with some left over coffee.In terms of the quality of the product, the jar is filled to the top which is great. It mixes well but gets pretty frothy. Don't know how good the protein is itself, I assume it's doing the trick and feeding the muscles. Overall it works fine but wished it was more flavorful.

Over the past decade, I've probably try a couple dozen different protein powders. I've tried cheap ones, expensive ones, name brand ones, the ones with the crazy names, and the newer ones popping up due to social media. None of them have been what I would consider great. Usually either the taste is off, it doesn't blend well, or the ingredients are horrifying. This protein powder is by far the best one I have ever tried. I've had three flavors and they've all been great (no weird artificial taste). The ingredients are perfect, and it blends extremely easily in a normal shaker bottle. I will definitely be using this for the foreseeable future. Highly recommended!

I don’t know if this is just the packaging influencing my thinking, but to me this has a grassy, farm-like taste and even smell!  Feels more substantial to drink than other powders I’ve tried, more like a real snack or small meal.  However out of the three protein powders I’ve tried I would rate this one lowest in terms of taste.  My favorite is still Dymatize ISO-100 so I probably wouldn’t buy this again.

This is a review for the 'Chocolate Mocha' flavor of Levels 100% Grass Fed Whey.So, I started working out regularly again, and looked into the wild, vast field of protein supplements. Before taking Levels' product, I was using MyProtein's Whey Isolate Chocolate Smooth. I was primarily looking for an alternative sourced from ethically minded dairy farms, and decided to give Levels a try.Looking at the ingredients list, there seems to be a focus on keeping things 'natural'. There are no added sugars, and they use two sweeteners to enhance the flavor. One is stevia leaf extract, and the other is monk fruit extract. In other whey protein powders, I sometimes see artificial sweeteners like sucralose. One point there, if you're concerned about that.Non-GMO sunflower lecithin is another notable ingredient. Lecithin is used to improve the texture of whey protein powders when mixed (gives that smooth/silky feel). Soy lecithin is the cheapest and most commonly used form, so you'll find it often in other whey protein powders. Now, you can read up all sorts of stuff about the dangers of soy, soy lecithin, extraction methods of soy lecithin, and soy allergies. Some of it may be overblown, some of it may be valid. If soy is a concern to you, though, the usage of sunflower lecithin in Levels offers an alternative.Finally, we round things out with decaffeinated coffee and cacao powder, which presumably provide the lion's share of the chocolate mocha flavor. As for the flavor itself, I would say it is neither weak nor strong, but it does get quite muddled, the more stuff you add to your shake. For me, the flavor really comes out in a minimal mix - a banana, cashew milk, and a scoop of the powder. There's definitely some sweetness there, but not overwhelming, even with the addition of a banana. Instead, it's got this pleasant earthiness blended in, which I presume comes from the coffee. It's not going to blow you away with intensity, I think, but it's still nice enough that I look forward to one after a workout. Again, the only thing is that if you like adding stuff, it doesn't take a whole lot for the flavor to get lost in the mix.Minor quibbles -1.After the efficient, resealable bags offered by MyProtein, I find the big jar Levels' whey protein comes in to be rather bulky. Then again, maybe the container is more recyclable than a bag.2. I mentioned MyProtein earlier. One of the reasons they are the current go to brand is because of third party lab testing confirming protein content. labdoor.com published results for MyProtein brands, which show them consistently ranking quite high. If Levels could do something similar with an independent testing company, it might be useful to folks who are thinking of trying out a new product.All that aside, my one major issue is the lack of readily available information on a few things. From their website:""Levels Grass-Fed Whey comes from certified humane suppliers across the country and we guarantee our whey is from 100% grass-fed pasture raised dairy cows.""Awesome. However, I could not locate any information on who these suppliers are, in order to independently verify if they are actually certified humane and their livestock primarily subsist on grass. If it's on the website and I somehow missed it, I'll edit the review as necessary.Otherwise, this is a perfectly fine whey protein powder, with selective use of ingredients and a stated commitment to using 100% grass fed and humanely treated cows.

Saw some ""Tastes more like coffee than chocolate"" or ""not sweet"" in the reviews. So, I decided to give the mocha a try. The initial taste is very fake sweetener, a tad chemical, and a tad chalky kind of taste with some other disgusting flavor I can't quite put my taste buds on. After a few drinks, the flavor begins to taste more normal. In comparison to the 10 other whey protein powders I've tried, yes, I'd say it's overall less sweet and once you get past the initial flavors, it's bearable. I'd say it's a little thicker than most powders I've had. With all that said, it's still very sweet and I likely not buy it again. The price point does not match the taste. Ingredient-wise, sure. Flavored whey protein powders are tough to find without all the fake sugar. I guess I'll keep looking.

It was hard upping my protein game until I found this powder! I drink it first thing in the morning (two scoops with whole milk) and I feel great knowing I don't have to stress about eating a ton of protein throughout the day! I'm also ""prediabetic"", so the low sugar count is a plus.Best of all, our baby is healthy and growing well, so I know it's been good for both of us :)**It is definitely better mixed up in the blender. It turns into a silky smooth chocolatey goodness.Edit: I just tried the Chocolate Mocha. You can definitely taste coffee (which I've missed drinking!)

For the last six months or so, I've been aiming to eat at least 160 grams of protein every day. I find it almost impossible to hit that mark without the use of protein powder and/or bars. But I was nervous going the whey route at first because I previously had super painful digestive reactions to another powder, enough that it actually swore me off dairy products in general for a few years.The digestibility aspect is what initially brought me to the listing for this Levels protein powder. What left me buying it over other grass-fed whey products, though, was the promise of a ""lightly sweetened"" product. Most protein powders are *entirely* too sweet for my taste, and generally involve artificial sweeteners that leave a cloying aftertaste.I started with the vanilla flavor, and it was perfect for my needs. One scoop in a blender bottle with 4 ounces of oat milk and 12 ounces of cold brew coffee -- I never had any problems with blending it and the flavor was present but not overpowering against the coffee. I came back and ordered a 5 pound container of vanilla but received chocolate instead (I assume this was an Amazon problem, not a Levels problem). I was out of the previous container, so I used the chocolate anyway. It has the same positive qualities as the vanilla, it just isn't what I would consider particularly chocolatey. I add some cocoa powder if I really want a mocha vibe for my protein coffee.I also bought a 5 pound container of the unflavored powder to use in my overnight oatmeal. It's perfect for that application, blending smoothly with a little water, honey, cinnamon, and Greek yogurt when mixed with a fork (before adding the oats and some berries). I've eaten this every weekday morning for months with none of the digestive issues that previously drove me away from whey.Overall this product is exactly what I was looking for in a protein powder and is now my go-to option.

My wife had gastric sleeve surgery and is required to drink protein everyday. We used another brand but their price went way up so we decided to try this. The flavor, or lack of flavor is exactly what we expect. However it doesn't dissolve very well. Maybe that's the difference in price I don't know. My wife used to put protein powder in the shaker with the little wireball shake it a bunch of times and it would dissolve. Unfortunately this brand is not. For the protein the product is fine but I can't recommend the brand based on the inability to make a relatively smooth drink in a reasonable amount of time.

I am very rarely compelled to write reviews unless a product really impresses me. A nutritionist recently recommended Levels to me and I proceeded to buy the Vanilla Bean flavor which was excellent. I mix it with Almond milk to make my protein shakes. I read other comments that some other flavors aren't that great which can all be subjective. I was so impressed with the Vanilla Bean that I immediately ordered the chocolate flavor the next day. It was also incredible!!! This is the best-tasting protein shake I've ever had.

Updated 01/22/2018Previously I had given 1 star (see review below) because of what seemed like a change in formulation using bleach and other harsh chemical processes.  After some communication with Levels' staff I am changing my review to 4 stars.  They did provide third-party testing (SEE ATTACHED IMAGE) and it shows there are no bleach or heavy metal/toxins in the whey protein.  This is great news and I'm very impressed by the level of attentiveness and care with which Levels took to respond to my concerns about using bleach or other chemicals within their formulation.  They did acknowledge the change was indeed due to added lecithin to aid in mixability which is perfectly fine and in fact provides Phospholipids which have been shown to be good for brain health.  The only reason why I didn't go all the way to 4 stars was that the communication of the purity of this product needs to be on the package labeling which I'm hoping Levels does consider.  Since whey is a commodity product, the primary differentiator for most customers comes down to purity/quality and price.Seeing Levels' commitment to customer satisfaction was great and I'll definitely be ordering from Levels again!--------------------(old 2017 Review)I've tried every grass-fed whey protein on the market.  I was a huge fan originally of Levels Whey Protein, having purchased numerous times and back when they were using the box with the bag instead of the plastic container.  Unfortunately Levels is now using ACID/BLEACHING in their process, which completely DESTROYS the useful benefits of Grass-fed whey protein.  It would be like eating 5 Snickers bars with your diabetes medication.  The BLEACHING completely denatures the protein and DESTROYS all of the beneficial properties of consuming Grass-fed Whey like the Immunoglobulins, CLA, IGF-1 etc.  I've read some people complaining about a chemical after-taste with the new Levels Whey Protein.  That's because of the new BLEACHING agents they are using to make the protein easier to mix.In the picture I have Levels Whey protein on the left which was before they started using BLEACH and chemical solvents to process their whey protein.  On the right is the same flavor but the new Levels Whey which is BLEACHED/ACID chemical solvent protein powder which is much more fine but also STRIPS the benefits of Grass-fed Whey protein.I can no longer recommend purchasing a Grass-fed Whey Protein that uses bleach and other chemical solvents to process their protein. This makes buying grass-fed whey completely USELESS since all of the benefits of consuming grass-fed whey protein are gone.  When buying grass-fed whey protein make sure to look for ""no bleaching no chemical solvents""as well as ""cold processed"" and preferably ""third-party tested"".  I would implore Levels to go back to not bleaching their protein or using any chemical solvents as well as doing third-party testing.Unfortunately the only grass-fed whey that currently uses no bleaching or chemical solvents is Promix Grass-fed Whey protein.  I say unfortunately because they are expensive.  I just wish either Promix was priced like Levels or Levels was as rigorous about the quality of their protein as Promix.

Minimal ingredients and whey based, solid protein powder. Only knock I’ve found with it is if doesn’t blend/mix well. You have to add a ton of water or whatever else you’re blending with it.

This powder used to be great tasting and mixed very well. It’s different now. After mixing it leaves huge chunks. The taste is different too. It’s more frothy and doesn’t really taste like vanilla cinnamon anymore. It’s disappointing. I used to love this powder because of the ingredients and how well it mixed and tasted.

I'm no expert but I feel like this is one of the better Whey proteins out there.  No added junk, just pure whey.  Others have reviewed the nutrition merits so I'll go into consumption.When taking this I recommend only 1 cup of water per scoop.  If you add more water I think it tastes worse.  When I first started taking this I didn't like the taste and needed to add a spoon of my hot chocolate mix to it for taste.  Now I actually really like the taste of it with nothing added.  If you didn't know Whey is actually the protein from milk.  It doesn't taste like milk but you get maybe a hint of that taste.  I can't really describe it.Another trick I use is if you mix 1 cup of fruit punch and 1 scoop of Whey you get something that tastes like a delicious berry smoothie.  This will also give you a 1:1 carb / protein ratio in itself.  If I'm not working out at home I take one of these drinks with me so I can take it immediately after my workout or hockey game.Now just some tips I've picked up since you're looking to get Whey - muscle bulked up.  (keep in mind I'm on that route but I'm not all muscle yet)Carbs are you energy - I recommend getting your carbs in the morning, before your workout so you have enough energy to get through it, and post workout to help restore energy.  Half of a PB&J sandwich is my go to energy carb right now.  White bread gets absorbed and converted to energy very fast and it works well for me.  Carbs are needed to get the protein where it needs to go so don't go cutting them out completely.  Update - Sounds odd but don't neglect fat - you want about half as many grams of fat or less (preferably unsaturated) as you do protein.  You will suffer if you don't have any fat in your diet.  Sunflower seeds, nuts, peanut butter, avocados all have some fat you can use.I'm trying for somewhere around a 2:1:.5 to 1:1:.3 grams of carbs:protein:fat per pound daily.When to take your Whey?  There's some debate on whether to take Whey pre-workout or post-workout.  Some say both.  I used to go post but I recently switched to taking it pre-workout when I take my carbs (simple carbs around 45 minutes before workout) - logic being the protein will already be in your system for muscle repair.  I haven't practiced it enough to say which way is best though.  I also take a scoop in the morning.  If you go for the daily recommended 1 gram per pound you'll be taking it throughout the day.Burning Fat:  I'm a fairly skinny guy - however I've always had fat over my lower abs.  I want abs so that had to go.  I've lost almost all of that fat and here's how I did it.  To lose weight you simply need to burn more calories then you take in.  First, small meals / I make half sandwiches instead of whole ones now - when you go out to eat take home some of your meal in a doggie bag rather than forcing it all down.  I only eat when I'm hungry, wait for your hunger pangs and fight them a little.  If you're preoccupied with other things you can ignore hunger pangs easier.  If they get too bad go make make yourself a small meal.  If you fight hunger pangs for too long your energy levels will drop so go eat some carbs and it will pick them right back up.  I'd take a multivitamin to make sure you're getting everything you need.  Do this and watch fat go away - it doesn't take long, I can see / feel a difference in my stomach every day.  When I do have a cheat day - sometimes the stomach wins or peer pressure and you just want to eat - the extra fat added on my belly is noticeable - but don't fret, you can burn it off in a day or two.Doing the above routine I lost a lot of fat eating a small bowl of cereal in the morning and a homemade hamburger for dinner.  So honestly I don't think what you eat matters so much as waiting for and resisting the hunger pangs a bit.  The end goal is to just burn more calories then you take in - so simply taking in less is an easy way to do that.Eating healthy:  Recently I started eating healthier.  It's a lot easier then you think.  Vegetables, low fat meats, egg whites.  Spend some time in the produce section of the grocery store and you'll find a lot of good, quick finger food you may have not considered before.  My lunches are mostly all vegetables now.  Cherry tomato's, broccoli, mushrooms, baby carrots, lettuce.  All things you can just grab out of your fridge and snack on.  Hard boil some eggs, put them in a bag in your fridge and you'll have egg whites whenever you want.  Tuna, mackerel, sardines, frozen tilapia fillets (microwave for 1:30 or so) for fish protein.  Skinless chicken breasts or whatever - marinate them in Italian dressing - sprinkle some Weber Gourmet Burger seasoning on right before cooking - cover in tin foil and pop in the oven at 350 degrees for around 40 minutes - delicious.  I cook extra to refrigerate and microwave later.  Not as good as out of the oven but still good.  I've never been much of a chef - just picking up stuff along the way.  If you have other healthy foods you like please share.  I'm always looking to add to my menu.Workouts:  Why the heck is this last?  Hah, I'll just say I've been doing the p90x routine, I'm on week 5 and loving it.  I find it helps to have something guide you rather than just going to the gym and doing whatever you feel like.  When you're working out you get exhausted and don't want to think so I would find a good complete routine that switches things up, allows rest days, keeps you motivated, and is easy to follow.  Of course take that with a grain of salt, as I said I don't have huge muscles yet - this is just what I've learned so far.

Flavorless whey protein isolate is an ideal choice for those who want to add protein to their diet without the added taste! This type of protein powder is easy to mix and can be added to smoothies, oatmeal, or other recipes. It provides high-quality protein to support muscle growth and recovery after exercise, without any added sugars or artificial flavors which is SUPER important to me. So much indigestion from fake sugars.

I've been consistently working out for over 12 years I've switched from flavor to unflavored.

This is exactly what I was looking for in terms of a flavorless protein. Just wish the scoop  that came with it was different. It is huge and some cross between a square and a triangle and barely fits in the container once you dig it out of the powder the first time. But at least you dont have to use it if you dont want to.

The whey protein isolate itself is good. However, I have to nitpick on the other stuff.  Serving size is 28g, but a full leveled scoop is 35g. There's a line for 28g, but honestly they should have reduced the scoop size. The scoop is also an odd rectangular shape, while most shaker bottles are cylindrical, so, you have to carefully line up the scoop to not spill any powder. Other than that, great product for the price.

I'm posting this to help educate some folks who are new to protein powders.  It seems like most protein powder ads (hence information) is geared toward people who work out and want to build muscle.  That's not me.  I am a middle aged woman, and added protein powder to my diet because it was brought to my attention that some of my weight and hunger issues were due to insufficient protein in my diet.  This turned out to be accurate.  The older we get, the less efficiently our bodies process protein.  I found an online calculator that takes gender, age, height, weight, activity level and so forth into account and spits out the average macronutrient count for someone like you.So first, after doing scads of reading, I chose whey protein because it is ""complete,"" meaning it has all the amino acids that make for a full protein, and I've tried both the isolate and the concentrate.  I just finished a 5 lb container of concentrate (Naked Whey), and have decided to go back to isolate.  But that's just me.  Isolate requires a smaller amount of powder (one scoop) to get the same protein as concentrate (two scoops) but there are some other differences that might matter to you.  A couple I'll mention are (1) if you're lactose intolerant (I'm not), the isolate is your go to product, and (2) the concentrate apparently has more ""bioactive peptides.""  If you want to understand all this before deciding, here's a good place to start: [...]Now, what I really want to address is the confusion around taste and mixability.  First let's start with ""taste.""  Obviously, if the product has been flavored, it will taste like the added flavor, but I'm talking about ""unflavored"" product.  All that is meant by that is that no flavoring has been added.  Although the unflavored version's flavor is relatively underwhelming, there is no such thing as taste-free whey.  If you've ever tasted dry coffee creamer powder, it has a taste similar to coffee creamer but less sweetness.  If you hate that taste, you will not like the flavor of whey - isolate or concentrate.  I happen to like the flavor of coffee creamer (confession:  i'm pretty sure my freshman 15 was because i ate coffee creamer out of the jar in college - but that was a long time ago).  On the other hand, the flavor is not overt.  Many flavors either compliment it or are strong enough to cover it - fruit, avocado, coco powder, peanut butter, yogurt, rice pudding, oatmeal, creamy soups, etc.  I've even mixed protein powder into guacamole without being able to taste it over the other flavors (avocado, lime, green chilis, cilantro, garlic).  I've mixed protein powder into egg omelets (the concentrate) with the added advantage of stretching the eggs into the most fluffy omelets you've ever seen.  Mostly though, I mix it into yogurt and toss a few berries on top.On the other hand, there are things you definitely don't want to mix it into, and these are things that are ""thin,"" like water, iced tea, lemonade, miso and other clear broths, etc.  For example, people here have asked whether you can blend protein powder into your iced tea.  If you like your iced tea asian style, creamy with milk, then possibly.  But if you do not like thickened, creamy tea, no way.Mixing:  Blender or fork or whisk?  I use a fork because it's easier to clean and faster to grab.  But unless lumps are something you enjoy, you still have to put some energy into it.  Isolate is easier to mix into your liquid.  It just is. Maybe because half the quantity takes half the energy, or maybe due to property differences in the products.  If anyone knows, please do tell.  Concentrate, is most easily mixed into creamy or thick things like yogurt.  If you're a body builder and need constant protein in the form of shakes, beverages, etc, a blender is recommended.  If you hate cleaning your blender then I'd probably go isolate.Whey - both types - mixes better into cool liquids than warm ones.  However, I've discovered that you can overcome this problem by ""tempering"" your whey mixture the way you would temper eggs.  Thoroughly mix your whey into a cool liquid first, then slowly mix in a little warm liquid until the the temperature has warmed up, and then add the warmed mixture to your hot liquid.  I used to do that to add whey and milk into my tea (I learned milk in tea in Nepal) but in the end I rejected this because whatever it is I personally like  - pretty sure it's the fat content - of putting milk into tea is undermined by the presence of the whey.  So now I just dump my morning whey into yogurt and drink my tea the way I like it.I hope this information about the two types of whey, their taste and mixability is helpful to some of you.

I ONLY buy all-natural protein (NO Aspartame/Acesulfame-k/Sucralose, NO chemicals or artificial colors/flavors/colors)!  And anyone consuming protein is presumed to be inherently health-conscience, so why would anyone consider ANY protein powder with this crap in it?  That is beyond me.  There are 1,000 flavors (double-chocolate chip cookie dough, triple espresso fudge cake, cake batter, blue lemon truffle punch, etc...) I mean seriously?  Are there millions of morbidly obese body builders out there who need their protein shake to taste like their favorite candy-bars and screw their health in the process??  Anyway, I'll get off my soapbox, but for the rest of you who don't want cancer or brain-tumors and actually care about what they shove into their bodies, then look no further than this protein powder!  Ok, I've spent many days doing the research to see if I can de-throne my current protein king powder (""Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Natural Whey Protein Powder"") which I absolutely love!  But wanted to see if there was something better or just as good for cheaper.  Enter this product.  Now, this review is to compare these two highly rated kings!  These 2 powders are the best of the best when it comes to All Natural.  To help with the analysis, please refer to the attached diagram.  So, the bottom line is that for $1.00...  NOW=39g protein,  ON=30.9g protein.  So, with NOW, you get 26% more protein for the same buck!  Hows that for a ""dollar menu"" analysis.  They are both highly rated and are both EXCELLENT choices...  however, the difference is the ON has sugar (yes, natural sugar!) and has natural flavoring, so of course humans like sweet things so it gets the edge on taste (10/10 in my book... I literally love it just as much as a milkshake and it isn't that sweet, just enough to be lightly evident but not unhealthy).  Now, the reviews for this NOW said it tasted horrible and bitter and I was really afraid to buy it but due to the $ per gram of protein and appearing an even healthier choice compared to the ON, I thought I'd try it.  Let me tell you, it is totally awesome!  Now, not as awesome as the sugar sweetened ON, but for having nothing in it but 100% protein (no sweetner/flavors) it is totally OK!!!  Now... let me preface these ""taste"" statements with one thing... I ALWAYS use milk in my protein shakes (16 oz milk - fat-free / 1% / 2% / whole) with 2 scoops protein, blend 20-seconds, drink.  I thought I'd have to mix half/half of NOW/ON but I really don't.  The NOW tastes just neutral, like I'm just drinking milk (which I love) but the same or even a little better than just plain milk.  Now, given that NOW has no sugar/flavoring, it is a ""more"" natural choice compared to the ON.. and on top of that, has 26% more protein per $1.00 spent... I'm totally sold!  If I'm in the mood I can flavor it with vanilla, honey, chocolate, peanut butter, bananna.  Or, it tastes neutral enough to where I don't feel I have to drown the flavor out with any of those things... because at least with milk, it tastes great just by itself!!  Plus, the NOW has the added benefit of being flavor-neutral for usage in recipes (w/o inadvertantly adding sweet/flavored(vanilla/chocolate) flavor to your favorite recipes.  Another fringe benefit worth noting is that the NOW is still a 5.0 lb jug.  It is not trying to sneakily down-size to 4.8lb (like the ON)... this is how manufacturers do it slowly so you're still paying the same $50/tub but the tub is now a wee-bit smaller... evil, evil, I say.  Anyway, both of these are my absolute favorite proteins, but taking a deep-dive into the nitty gritty details... there has emerged one-clear winner to rule all of the natural proteins out there (IMHO).  Thanks for reading and I hope this helps you (I took out 3 hours on my day off to put this review together for you!).  Let me know if this was helpful to you or if you have any questions.  thanks!

I use Now Foods Whey Protein Isolate to boost my brain/neurotransmitter health more than a weight lifting supplement.  Amino Acids are profoundly powerful in regulating the functions of the brain and body and unfortunately today's modern diet is so devoid of these powerful substances that we can see the symptoms everywhere: chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety, etc.  Now Foods Whey Protein Isolate is the ONLY protein supplement I have ever found that has every ESSENTIAL amino acid and every NON-ESSENTIAL amino acid, go look at the back of any and every other brand you come across, at best they'll have a half dozen amino acids, and nowhere close to the same density of protein to calories![This doe NOT contain Asparagine, Glutamine, and Ornithine; however  (1)Asparagine is derived from Aspartic Acid, which the supplement does contain, via transamidation; (2)Glutamine's side-chain is an amide formed by replacing the side-chain hydroxyl of glutamic acid with an amine functional group, making it the amide of glutamic acid, again, which is contained in the supplement; (3)Ornithine is not an amino acid coded for by DNA, and, in that sense, is not involved in protein synthesis, but can be biosynthesised in the body by arginine and Aspartic Acid, so even there, Now Foods Whey Protein Isolate has you covered.With regard to the amino acid profile, what I like the most is the presence of several specific amino acids that all revolve around the problems of fatigue, depression, and insomnia.  Now Foods Whey Protein Isolate contains both L-Phenylalanine and L-Tyrosine (and in quantites large enough to achieve the effects described below) which are instrumental in healthy mind and body function.  Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine which together produce the three most abundant catecholamines in the human body:  dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline).  Catecholamines (the number two most common deficiency amongst neurotransmitters) are the brain chemicals that make us feel energized and give us the ability to concentrate. Got ADD? It’s caused by a deficiency in catecholamines. Need that cup of coffee to get going? You’re most likely low in catecholamines. And if you’re self-medicating with coffee or chocolate, you’re doing damage to your serotonin levels in the process.  Tyrosine is such a powerful amino acid that it has even been researched for use in Military applications.  Its potency was explained with three major conclusions in the Journal ""Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine."" [1992 May;63(5):364-9.]:""First, various forms of stress induce brain depletion of catecholamines, especially norepinephrine, in animals. Second, brain norepinephrine levels are closely related to stress-induced performance decrement in animals. Third, the administration of tyrosine may minimize or reverse stress-induced performance decrement by increasing depleted brain norepinephrine levels. ""Need a more ""tangible""piece of evidence for the importance of L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine in energy?  Look at the back of those ""5 Hour Energy"" shots which have become ubiquitous,  you'll notice that they're nothing more than a dose of L-Phenylalanine and L-Tyrosine.  One thing I do wish the Now Foods Whey Protein Isolate contained is D-Phenylalanine which is a powerful supplement that can be used to regulate your bodies natural opioid system which recent research is now showing to be MORE important in regulating mood and depression in certain individuals than the serotonergic system (which all SSRI and SNRI class antidepressants like Paxil and Zoloft work on  or DON'T work on depending on your experience).  D-phenylalanine, in particular, has been postulated to inhibit the enzymes that breakdown enkephalins (natural opioid compounds 50x more potent than morphine) by blocking the enzyme carboxypeptidase A, giving it a potential analgesic or pain-killing profile.Lastly I like how Now Foods Whey Protein Isolate contains L-tryptophan an essential amino acid that CANNOT be produced by the body and as such must be consumed through diet.  Tryptophan is instrumental in the production of Serotonin, which can in turn be converted to melatonin (both serotonin and melatonin deficiencies are thought to produce insomnia and irregular sleep patterns) and Niacin.  Serotonin is the number one neurotransmitter deficiency recorded which would explain why so many people feel depressed and are on anti-depressants.  In almost every study however, Anti-depressants have been proven to be less effective than exercise alone.  Furthermore, the addition of L-tryptophan and 5-htp to one's diet has been proven to elevate levels of serotonin higher than both paxil and zoloft.So, if you're like me and not a body builder, but want to greatly improve one's own physical and mental health, Now Foods Whey Protein Isolate is the ONLY protein supplement  you will need.  I urge you to compare the the nutritional facts on the back of the label to that on any other protein supplement and you will see that not one comes close to the amino acid profile of Now Foods Whey Protein Isolate.

This company has been a reputable manufacturer over the years for supplements so that helped in choosing this particular brand and i have purchased this a few times from here because the price was the best i could find for the quality of  protein this is, it breaks down or mixes well enough when used with a good shaker bottle, i usually use a cup of hot water with 2 servings(scoops) and any other powders i plan to add in the blender for my smoothies, as for the flavor its flavorless and for me they were pretty spot on with that claim. No complaints when you only need it for the protein content, it does seem to cake a little so using this in oatmeal and other things you consume slower might not be ideal, its a great protein for anyone wanting a fast absorbing protein supplement with little to none going to waste.Whey Isolate and Hydrolyzed Whey is some of the highest in bioavailability (the amount your body can use compared to how much is wasted) if your looking for something with little to no filler this is as good as it gets, Good luck finding success in your endeavors with whatever you choose!

First things first, blanket statement: every BODY is different and you will have to try this yourself to see if it has similar effects for you. There are big positives and in my case also very big negatives that forced me to begrudgingly quit using this product. I do wish I could still use it because it was the best.ULTIMATE SUMMARY: It made my muscle bigger better than any other and also gave me heart palpitations. Laying in bed trying to sleep my heart jumped to 120 bpm with no stimulation. Scared me s***less, felt like no other sensation, and is the reason I'm writing this review. Keyword L-Phenylalanine. Read on for details.GOOD NEWSThis protein is the only one of about 15 or so that I've tried that has immediate and measurable anabolic effects. Take a scoop 45 min to an hour before your work out, and in my case it feels like a creatine pump. It's that intense. Read the amino acid profile and you'll see why. Everything is there. You will gain muscle.What separates this protein from every other high dollar mix that I've tried, including all the top reviewed mixes here on amazon, is that the gains are simply faster and more noticeable. End of story. I'm recovering from a neck injury and have not been able to consistently lift heavy for over a year now. Without heavy weight, muscle gains are hard to find. I'm mostly battling muscle loss at this point, but this protein has put extra width on my arms in just the first half of the bottle. Get the idea? It works better than any other and second place doesn't even come close. Like I said, with this stuff, my pumps feel like creatine pumps.Now the bad:Read the amino acid profile very closely and look up all the aminos within a legitimate medical journal of any kind. Your biggest concern here is L-Phenylalanine. Long story short, this stuff COULD raise your blood pressure, which COULD lead to heart palpitations or ""sudden acute tachycardia"" in my case. If you're old or unhealthy, this COULD lead to heart attack or death. After taking this stuff, admittedly and definitely in unsafe excess, I've got blood pressure loud enough to keep my from falling asleep and I experienced my very first tachycardia heart flutter at the ripe age of 26.  I've been an athlete 10 years, have knowingly pushed my heart to the limit, have a resting heart rate of 56 when I wake up, and have never had heart trouble of any sort ever. Medical records to prove it. There are no other clear variables that could be as directly responsible as taking nearly 3g of phenylalanine a day.The details: I was so excited about the clear anabolic effects of this protein that I started taking 3 scoops a day, instead of eating 3 servings a meat a day. Obviously that was stupid and you shouldn't be stupid. I did feel a rise in my blood pressure within 5 or so days. And when I say feel, I mean FEEL. Enough that I took a closer look at that label, did my research, stopped taking it, bought a blood pressure monitor, gave it a while to clear, and then started taking 1 scoop a day for several weeks now.Then just a few hours ago I had the sudden palpitation after laying in bed trying to sleep for several hours. Young guy no heart trouble, highly trained amateur athlete, sudden high blood pressure and tachycardia? I'll settle for ""average"" arms in exchange for my healthy functioning heart.CLOSING THOUGHTSEverybody is still different. It may not effect you this way. I had no previous trouble to indicate this would be a concern; you'll have to just try it for yourself and gauge your own results. Good judgement comes from experience. Experience comes from bad judgement. AKA this stuff is powerful so don't use it in excess like I did.PS THOUGHTSAfter having adverse reactions to nearly everything man made product I've tried (this stuff and my heart experience, creatine monohydrate with balding and prostate enlargement, D-aspartic acid with balding again, citrulline mallate again balding from the creatine availability increase, arimidex with intensely unnatural and panicky dreams, baclofen with the numbing limbs, etc) I've decided that it's far healthier to eat from the earth and barn instead of the lab and factory. I've never had any adverse effects from a medium rare ribeye and collard greens.

Great unflavored protein supplement. Palatable when mixed with just water. Excellent mixed with yogurt or blended in to  nearly any baked recipe.

I've tried lots of powders over time. For the price, quality, and the quantity, this powder is great.Blends easily and doesn't taste too awful.Does not taste great with water—would recommend using milk if able. There is a bit of an unpleasant after taste. Would recommend adding a flavor of your choice (cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa, etc) and a sweetener of your choice.Overall, would recommend if you're on a budget.

Good amount of protein, can mix easily with just water or for smoothie. I personally think “flavorless” taste could be better but it’s not horrible

There are two major proteins in the supplement world; *Whey* and *Casein*.We will talk about whey.Whey protein comes in 4 major forms: concentrate, isolate, hydrolysate and native whey.*Concentrates*: The lowest quality of all the whey protein forms. Around 30%-90% protein by weight, but generally 80%+.  Concentrates have a significant amount of fat, cholesterol and carbs in the form of lactose.  Most protein blends have a significant amount of concentrate and it’s fairly cheap.  Whey concentrates are typically more complete and generally has more bioactive components.*Isolates*: Isolates are processed to remove the fat and lactose.  Around 90%+ protein by weight.  The purest protein source. While highly pure, many of the bioactive components are broken down during processing. Very high quality.  Perfect for lactose intolerant individuals as there is no lactose.  More expensive.  Also perfect for those who want strictly protein and not additional carbs.*Hydrolysates*: Predigested (long chains of amino acids that are broken down into single aminos).  Because of this process, it is assumed that digestion would be absorbed quicker.  Mainly in bodybuilding supplements for this reason.  However some studies have shown that because protein is already quickly absorbed in its original form, predigested hydrolysates does not necessarily lead to faster absorption. (Power O, Hallihan A, Jakeman P. Human insulinotropic response to oral ingestion of native and hydrolyzed whey protein. Amino Acids. 2009.)*Native Whey*: Considered the purest form of whey.  Native whey is extracted from skim milk and is not a byproduct of cheese production.I used to add whey concentrate based protein powder to my shakes as my morning and evening protein shakes and always ended up with terrible gas!  And sometimes I had to take the browns to the superbowl too early in the season.  Little did I know that being lactose intolerant was the cause for the whey not cool bodily affects.First, I started to take lactase to combat this, but soon discovered protein isolate.  What a godsend.  I enjoy NOW Foods Whey Protein Isolate because not only are they lactose free, they are unflavored as well.  Which means I can throw a scoop into my favorite drink without affecting the flavor.Another reason why I trust this product is because this protein was not part of the amino acid spiking scandal that many protein supplement companies were and still a part of.  Many popular supplement companies have been adding taurine, glycine, glutamine and creatine to protein powders to raise the protein (dietary) levels of their protein powders even though they are not nearly as beneficial as real food based protein.  This is allowed due to the FDA’s loose definition of protein.  While legal, companies manipulate consumers by counting nitrogen based bonds from acids (glycine, glutamine, creatine, or in taurines case; an acid in the amino family) and add it to the ‘protein count’ thus effectively misleading consumers to think that the 24g of protein they see on the nutrition label is derived from whey, but in fact, 5g+ grams are from one of these acids, but still count as a ‘protein’ because they are a part of the amino family.  All for the sake of trying to pinch a few pennies.  There is a class action lawsuit against Body Fortress, GNC and a few others because of this.  I hope you Google it for yourselves and educate yourselves.So people out there, remember, NEVER buy protein that has added one of these ingredients to its formula.  Stay away from special “proprietary blends” of protein and always stick to the purest form (isolate that is unflavored, unsweetened, with nothing added, especially artificial sweeteners like sucralose, aspartame and other unnecessary ingredients.  If you want the cleanest, purest protein for your buck!  Always check the labels for added ingredients!

This protein powder is the one I've bought the most because it's the right ingredients (isolate, unflavored, sunflower lecithin) for the best price. Sometimes the price shoots up and it's not worth it. I won't spend more than $60 on a 5 pound jug. I mostly wanted to let people know if your protein is smelling and tasting awful, it's because it's spoiled, not because it's low quality. Get a replacement or refund. This protein powder has always been fine, essentially no flavor or aroma. It mixes fine with some stirring. I just mix it with water.

I bought the 1 lb. size to try out the taste, etc of this protein.  I'm no nutrician and am choosing not to offer a lot of information on the health benefits of this product.  There are already other great reviews that I strongly agree with written by people that know much more than me.Now Foods appears to be, from everything I've been able to find/reseach on-line, a very good quality company that produces top notch, bio-active products that are worth spending a few extra dollars on over much of what the copetition has to offer.Whey Protein Isolate is the best, most pure quality of protein available.  This particular protein appears to have been made in a way that preserves more of the bio-active nutrients (proteins and amino acids) than how some/many/most other manufacturers process their protein powders.  This protein does not seem to have anything in it that is not natural.  In other words, all the bad stuff, artificial flavorings, etc have been left out of this product.This protein does clump some.  It does have some mild taste that is easily masked by my morning cereal or whatever you mix it with.  The taste does not rival that of a chocolate shake, nor does it taste bad.  It specifically does not in any way shape or form appear to be foul smelling or tasting to me.  It is also hard for me to imagine how anyone could suggest this product would smell or taste foul.  (I mention this only because another reviewer mentioned taste in their review.)  Though to be fair, taste is a very subjective thing.  For how well it dissolves... I put a scoop in my morning cereal.  By the time I have made it half way through the bowl, the protein powder has completely disolved on its own.I have no negative comments to offer.  I do plan to try Allmax IsoNatural Whey Protein Isolate.  It is the only protein powder I've been able to find that could possibly be better than this one from Now Foods.  The IsoNatural is more expensive.  The two products are so close in terms of their perceived quality and nutritional content that I may opt for Now Foods in the end simply because it is cheaper.This is my two cents worth.  I hope you find it helpful.  Highly recommended!!***UPDATE 3/29/11*** I tried the Allmax IsoNatural Whey Protein Isolate.  Here's how they compared. I like the taste of the Now Foods whey a little better.  Neither was offensive.  While they were very similar, the Now Foods tasted slightly sweeter where the Isonatural (especially if you got a clump of it in your mouth) tasted a bit like (for lack of a better word) goo.  The Iso natural had a slightly higher content of protein by 1 gram. (Note: Their labels use different serving sizes. So, you have to do some math to equal things out.)  The Now Foods whey seemed to disolve a little easier.  If you are buying small quatities (1 or 2 lbs), they are very similar in price.  If you are buying 5 lb. containers, the Now Foods whey is much less expensive.  I give the nod to Now Foods!!

I’ve been using this exact protein powder (Now Sports Whey protein isolate, unflavored) for 10 years!  I take this at least once per day and occasionally twice per day. I haven’t tried anything I like better.I buy unflavored because I don’t like the artificial flavored taste. I have my own recipe that I’ve been using for many years that I will share with you...I’m not a nutritionist but in my opinion it’s a very well rounded meal replacement. This recipe taste much like a Reese cup or a no bake chocolate oatmeal cookie…In a shaker cup add 12oz of Silk Dark Chocolate Almond Milk.Add 2 1/2 tablespoons of Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter.Add 1/2 cup of oat flour.(you can make oat flour yourself by putting your unflavored Quaker Oatmeal into a food processor or blender. 2min oats blend best because they are already chopped more finely than old fashioned oats. Both will work though)And lastly, the most important part... one scoop of Now Foods unflavored whey protein isolate.Enjoy this shake along with an apple every morning. You’ll be full till lunch!It’s a lot of calories, which I’m totally okay with for my fitness goals but you may want to tweak the recipe for your own fitness needs.I say it’s well rounded because... I get my protein from the protein powder, simple carbs from the chocolate almond milk, complex carbs from the oatmeal and healthy fats from the peanut butter.It’s loaded with enough calories to carry a grown working man through the morning with having to stop for snacks. I’m also very active in the gym with free weights.Your results may vary.In closing,It mixes thin! Which I need for my protein shake recipe.It doesn’t taste terrible, even in water. (Just chase it with something with a lot of flavor and you’ll never even know you dank it.)It’s high quality with very few ingredients.It’s worth a try! Hope it work for you as well as it has me.

Was looking for a whey with nothing in it but whey and found this product. It mixes okay with just some water and a spoon. The taste is bearable. Not sure what to compare it to but it’s mild. I usually mix it in a smoothie that I make and can’t even taste it in there with all the other ingredients.I was taking ON’s whey for 5+ years then switched to their natural whey (still had other ingredients in it), then went to pea protein. Guess the older I got the more important it became for me to find something that didn’t have any fillers at all. This product fits that bill and has been working great.

This Whey protein powder is BY FAR the best Whey protein I have found and I have tried quite a few including Optimum Nutrition's best selling chocolate powder. This is pure, natural, unflavored (but I find it DELICIOUS - it tastes so natural, healthy and wholesome) Whey. I was a bit apprehensive of buying this at first because some people mentioned it tasted bad and smelled like rotten milk. I took a chance and bought it since I was really looking for a protein powder whithout artificial flavors and sweeteners. When I first mixed it in a glass of milk and tasted I could not believe it. It was THE MOST DELICIOUS Whey I had ever tasted. I prefer all things organic (I am not saying this powder is organic) and natural and from a controlled choice of natural preservative and artificial flavor free foods over a period of time, I have developed an ability to find the subtle healthful flavors of natural whole foods while others may miss it or may like 'slightly processed' (if not 'artificial') flavors. The reason I am stating this is because I have seen that anyone who has been living on unprocessed, natural wholesome foods will be able to taste more subtle flavors found in nature than the average person thriving on processed foods and artificial flavors AND such a natural food lover will LOVE pure natural flavors like this Whey protein powder. There is something pure, healthy and wholesome in natural flavors which is very different from artificial flavors. Others who are used to strong artificial flavors (ex. artificial chocolate, vanilla, strawberry etc) will not be able to appreciate the natural goodness of this powder.This is an amazing protein powder. When had with water its almost tasteless. When mixed with milk it makes the milk so much more creamy, delicious and wholesome tasting. AND - it can be had with almost anything because it will not impart any strong taste of its own to it. I have a scoop of this mixed in my ULTIMATE MORNING SUPERFOOD DRINK (designed by myself). Here's the recipe that will change your life - One glass of freshly squeezed orange juice (its not to be even compared with packeted orange juices), one teaspoon of Sun Chlorella powder, one teaspoon of Nutrex Spirulina , one scoop of Now foods Whey protein powder and one tablespoon of Nutiva Chia Seeds. This will change anyone's life who tries it. I used to be fatigued, tired, depressed, irritable in a certain phase in the past attributable mainly to work load, irregular hours and a flawed diet. Then I decided to take control of my life - I read everything I could on healthy foods and eating, a natural cruelty free lifestyle and exercise. Long story short - this concoction was one of my several self composed recipes (amongst many other diet, exercise and lifestyle regimens) that changed my life in a way that is UNBELIEVABLE. As far as my breakfast is concerned - with this pure superfood from heaven I am off to a super alert, super energized, super powered and ecstatic day with a calm mind and a warm smile. At night - thanks to this (the mix I mentioned) I sleep the deepest and most rejuvenating sleep imaginable.

I am into many sports and protein isolate is a necessity to me since no beef or chicken for me. I have been consuming whey protein isolate unflavored by Now Foods for last few years in five and ten pound containers and bags. The price has been going up so I tried to see if there is any product compatible exactly to Now Foods isolate. I mean pure whey protein isolate, no additives, no gum, no sweeteners, no additional anything, nothing more than pure protein, no vanilla, no chocolate, just unflavored pure protein.Bob's Red Mill sells protein concentrate which is not organic but that is great post workout not before workout. Jay Robb is the worst, They do not have any pictures of their products especially the back of the packaging on their Internet site so I was not even able to read the ingredients or nutritional value and what they claimed on their site is different than what printed on the packaging. Nature's Best, Isopure Natural in 3lb container is the closest I came. I called Nature's Best as well as Now Foods. I read both labels and found out;1. Now Foods prints on the label Manufactured by NOW FOODS, Made in the U.S.A. and Nature's Best prints Distributed by Nature's Best, Hauppauge, NY,2. Now Foods prints ingredients Microfiltered Whey Protein Isolate (milk) but Nature's Best has the same plus Ion Exchange Whey (Milk) protein Isolate.3. Jay Robb claims Sourced from grass fed cows not treated with rBGH on their Internet site. No grass fed cows printed on the labeling with more questionable issues of rBGH printed on the back panel. When I called their offices, no human being answered the phone, instead they put me on hold with some music. It is not made or manufacture in US, it is distributed in US. It has additives, gum, etc. and offers no nutritional information anywhere on his site.Ion Exchange requires heat and chemical which kills nutrients and that is why Now Foods vs. Nature's Best compares calcium% 13 to 4, potassium% 5 to 1, phosphorus% 7 to 2, magnesium% 6 to 0 and then unfortunately more of damaging goods sodium(mg) 40 to 170 and cholesterol(mg) 4 to 5. Why would anyone consume milk from China when Chinese are paying their relatives to carry milk from EU to China and would not even trust any wholesalers even selling milk from EU is a mystery to me. Now Foods have nutritionist who answered my questions. Nature's Best had secretary with no knowledge answering the phone and doing the best that she could. After all these years Now Foods still has the best, cleanest, no additives added, unflavored milk whey protein isolate made in USA with no competition at all. Obviously Now Foods Organic Unflavored Whey Protein is the best but it is concentrate not isolate.

I haven't had an 'unflavored' protein isolate that tasted very good - this is no exception. I have bought the 5lb unflavored tub a couple times over the course of the past few years here and there and the taste has been pretty consistently terrible in water, kind of offensive really.To get rid of that I will either put in some stevia or monk fruit vanilla sweetener or mix in some powdered peanut butter and cocoa together. The sweetener option makes it taste pretty good relative to the stock taste and the peanut butter/cocoa option makes it bearable with the benefit of around 6 grams of extra protein. Either way, I like that this is not loaded with artificial sweeteners/ingredients and I can add in my own, at the downside of increased cost.If you are a lactose sensitive person and want to use whey protein I think this might be a good option to avoid some of the bloat and digestive issues, although depending on how sensitive you are you might still need to add lactase (whey concentrate bloats me and gives me gas without lactase pills, this isolate doesn't seem to be a noticeable problem).

I bought this bag on sale. Unflavored protein should not be more expensive than regular flavored protein because it's cheaper to make. This Isolate whey had a good price to pass up.The flavor is good, the best way to describe the taste, it's similar to the McDonald's plain coffee creamer in those small packets. People saying the protein taste bad, taste like soap, would hate my fiber powder that taste a lot worse than this.The bag is cheap, arrived with small holes from being roughed up during shipping, the protein does not come with a scoop, i had to add my own measuring cup. The resealable zipper does not work, i had to reuse my 5lb protein plastic tub container I was about to recycle, to store this protein inside because of the cheap bag. It's not a big deal, it was a good buy, especially since this is pure protein with no added garbage that companies add for flavor. I mix this protein with about 10-12oz of water, i put in some PB fit healthy peanut butter powder, some cinnamon, and a ice cube, and the result is satisfying.

As the author of the Amazon Book, ""It's the Liver Stupid,""  I am interested in health and longevity,  but taste is important or no one would ever try it and get the benefits.  So, yes, if you understand the ""Undenatured Whey Protein Isolate Protocol,""  you know that the whey that we use is always undenatured.  This means that the product was prepared at low temperatures...  below 140 deg F.  Now never makes this claim,  but they allude to it.  The reason is that they do not want to go out on a limb and sell a product that may have been heated by mistake and make a false claim.  If you know the company, you know that they are always reliable and responsible.So, No,  this undenatured aspect is not a guarantee,  but it is implied.Next, as others here (and none, apparently understand what my book is going for),  say:  It is an excellent tasting product with good  texture and disolvability.  Most will enjoy using it.Additionally, if you understand the protocol,  you will know that Unnical,  the company that did the research proving that it extends live spans in mice, produces the finest quality product for this application,  but theirs is many times as expensive.  If you have the cash,  buy theirs,  but this is very good for this application.  Just use a little more of it and it will add years to your life while solving many bowel disbiosis problems.Finally,  my recommendation in using this product for this protocol  is as follows  In a coffee cup,  add two scoops of Whey,  a teaspoon of Moringa Leaf Powder,  a tablesoon of multicolored Maca,  cover it well with cream (preferably not from Holstein Cows, but grass fed), add a free range chicken or duck egg &  mix it thoroughly.  Now eat it with a spoon.  Once you have eaten most of it, fill the cup up with freshly brewed water caffeinated coffee and add more cream...  it makes a nice drink and this is a nutrient dense meal in itself.While we have no idea just how long this will extend your life,  given what we have seen, with the addition of High Level MSM,  and a Low Carb diet it could be several lifespans beyond normal. This is not all that you must do to make the methylation functions of your cells awaken 100%, but it is the bulk of it and it will add significant amounts of life-giving organic sulfur to your body as it does its work..

OK, seeing these other reviews on the high quality of this protein, I wont bother talking about that aspect of the product.  I don't know about how good it is or how much muscle it builds, but  since you all  have enough reviews by bodybuilders and trainers to let you in on that, I'll just chime in on the part where I can best contribute; its taste or lack thereof.  For those of you with very picky palates, or  if you have a difficult time taking supplements and powders, like I USED to,  you will finally find a home with this product.  In fact, I tried about 30 brands, and I hated each one (except MGN 100% protein isolate).  This one is truly amazing in that even my notorious taste buds could barely notice it was in the milk AT ALL!!  It truly shocked me.  So if you have a super picky palate (you know who you are)  forget anything that isn't 100% whey protein ISOLATE.  The other stuff, even if its called ""Gold"" or ""Diamond"" or ""Platinum"" standard, is nonetheless gritty and chalky to people who are sensitive to its presence in milk or juice. This brand, in particular, is fantastic in that it is tasteless for all intense and purposes. It instantly blends into the milk, no need for a blender.  I couldn't believe how fast it dissolved into the milk, without me needing to stir the spoon very much.Now, that said, as I have previously stated, I'm a picky eater,  and so even with this perfect protein, I do notice a little grittiness unless I pass it thru a superfine mesh strainer which takes out minute amounts of clumped up or undissolved protein. Mind you, the mesh catches almost nothing at all, compared to the clumped up globs of most other NON-isolate proteins which are mostly made of protein concentrate.  Once passed thru the mesh, the resulting milkshake is as smooth and silky as if grandma had just churned it herself out on the back porch.Moreover, this particular unflavored powder allows you all the benefit of the protein, but without interfering at all with any flavors you want to add- thus allowing for endless variety.  Or if you are a purest, then just put it in your milk, and if you taste it's presence to a degree that  bothers you at all, then apply to a nearby culinary school, or Ben and Jerry's tasting lab because you, my friend, must truly have one of the world's most virtuoso sets of regally snobby  taste buds.  Trust me,  I too have picky buds  (my personal nightmare) and this brand's protein leaves them quite happily undisturbed.

I've used NOW Whey Protein products off and on for years now and they always provide me with exactly what I'm looking for. Not much fluff, good macros, mostly Whey, non soy lecithin and a good price. Packing 25g of protein per serving, I usually quaff a few shakes a way with ~40g (1.6 servings) a day to round out of intake. I mix it with unsweetened almond milk and stevia. Sometimes I throw a serving of cacao in there for a nice chocolate treat.This mixes easy, low to no foam and while unflavored whey is supposed to have no taste having sampled many brands I can tell you some of those ""unflavored"" brands have a poor taste. NOW is not one of them as it has a very nice neutral taste that sits well on my system.I'm sure I'll eventually branch out and try other brands again as I'm a sucker to try something new......AND I'm sure I'll be returning to NOW in the future too.5/5

A lot of the criticism levied against this product on here is unfounded.  Is this powder the greatest thing ever? No. However much of the 'negatives' reflect customers who should not have purchased this product to begin with.  I will attempt to explain why.First off, people say that it is ""too foamy"" when blended.  Well, maybe you should buy a protein powder with a chemical in it to inhibit foaming.Second off, people say that it does not taste good.  Well, maybe you should buy a protein powder with a chemical in it to taste like some artificial flavor.This product has 2 ingredients in it, which is why I bought it.  I think it's digusting how long the list is on a lot of the boutique powders, and if you ask a sales rep. what they do, they can only give you the company line- which is 90% of the time not even remotely medically accurate.  It's basically cutting the stuff  need to make more money.  So, first ingredient here is Microfiltered Whey Protein.  That's what you want, warts and all. Flavor, color, texture- if you wanted WPI- then deal with it. Second ingredient is Soy Lechithin which is less than 1% of the product (it says so on the packaging).  That's for (brace yourself, big word coming up) emulsification.  In other words, it keeps powder, well, powdery.  It basically prevents the whey (milk product) from caking up or breaking down.  It's basically in everything you eat.Sorry to disappoint you that there isn't any more to talk about.  Honestly, you can look up whey protein isolate on wikipedia- what it does, what it does not do.  Try doing the same with all the rat poison ingredients in other stuff, and then write a review praising how good it is for you.  I'm sure there actually is truth in some of it, I just don't find it necessary for what I am trying to do.  If you don't like the taste, do what I do- 4 ounces of V-8 V-Fusion and 4 ounces of milk, and a shot of some schnapps.  Makes it taste perfect.Oh, and it does foam up a lot.  After blending 9 ounces, I can't pour it all into a 14 ounce glass.

I bought this Protein Powder because I didn't want a bunch of artificial sweeteners or other random chemical ""food products"" in my protein powder. That's basically what this is and it's really good but you need to know a few things before buying this:1. This has virtually no carbsYou need carbs as part of your protein shake in order to maximize the benefits of a post workout shake. There are lots of studies about the perfect ratio of carbs to protein (Google it). Since this is basically pure protein, you need to get that ratio yourself. This means you can't just mix this with water and expect a perfect product. If you want a perfect ratio, you need to do some measuring and math. I just usually mix it with milk and some healthy breakfast shake mix call it good. I've also done chocolate milk with this.2. It tastes mildly bad by itselfIt has a very mild flavor but that flavor is a bad ""sour milk"" flavor as some other reviews have mentioned. Just mixing this and water is pretty much disgusting. However if you mix this with milk, you hardly notice it's even there. It tastes basically like whatever you put it in as there's no added flavors. Don't expect to use this like other protein drinks with just water. That's probably where most of the negative ""Tastes Bad"" reviews come from. You can't treat this like another protein mix. They have a lot of flavors to mask any bad tastes. This is pure Whey Protein. You have to add your own flavoring.3. It mixes OK but not greatThis is my only real complaint about the product. It's really really fine (think flour) and you'd think it'd mix well. Not so much. It does mix eventually but it takes a while. I've had some powders that clump no matter how much you mix it. This isn't like that. It will eventually mix (I use both and electric blender and the BlenderBall cup) but it takes a while. Since it is fine, any clumps you do get don't have that grainy texture. They actually kind of tend to melt in your mouth (sort of a weird way to describe it but the best I can do).Final Verdict:I would recommend this product to just about anyone, but you just have to remember what you are purchasing when you use this product. It's a great healthy alternative to the hundreds of ""chemically enhanced"" protein powders out there. Just remember that you will be responsible for adding your own flavoring and carbs. Don't mix with only water.

I was nervous this would taste bad because it is unflavored.  However it has a nice creamy milky taste.  I have mixed it without issues.  I sometimes mix it in with nut butter to use as a higher protein spread.  Overall I am pleased with the product.

The first thing I want you readers to know about any whey protein isolate product is that your body can only absorb 8-10g of protein an hour.  If you want to check this information just find a sports nutrition website like I did. What this means is that most people have been putting in one scoop or 25g for a serving so they are wasting 15g or more of the protein product.  Also, If you are exercising or working out, the total intake for the day should be 1/2g times your body weight in pounds. If you want to save money, just mix in 10g (1/2 scoop = 15g) with water or your favorite liquid and drink one every hour until you reach your maximum.The NOW Whey Protein Isolate is one of the best products. It only has two ingredients and no artificial sweeteners and it is unflavored which leaves no aftertaste. I sometimes put in oat milk to flavor it, but you can use anything.  I bought the 5 pound container which really isn’t that much when you take it the way it is supposed to be taken and not what it says on the label. They just want you to buy more powder sooner for those that just use one or two scoops a day. It was delivered the same day I ordered it which was really great because I needed to get started right away to rebuild my lost muscle.  I strongly recommend this product!

Personally, I prefer larger amounts of protein so I won’t have to worry about not having enough one day.. and this bag is just that.I was able to fill my 7.5 lbs isopure bucket with the first half of the bag… and still had another half packaged away for the future.First time going with an unflavored whey, and it wasn’t bad at all. I mean it definitely tastes like whey, but I still mixed about a half pound of strawberry flavored isopure with it.Can’t speak on results just yet, but let’s be honest.. the nutritional content is pretty similar to Isopure’s, so let’s hope for the same shredded results 👆🏽👉🏽

tl;dr: it's lead, and it's nothing.I've been using this powder for years. My latest shipment, for the first time, had a sticker on it that says ""California Residents Proposition 65 WARNING: This product contains a substance known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm."" Even though birth defects are not an issue for me (I'm male, and I'm also not planning on having kids), it drove me crazy that they didn't say what substance the warning was for. I also failed to find the answer anywhere online. (NOW Foods does have a ""California Residents Proposition 65 Warning FAQs"" page, but it doesn't specifically cover this product.)I asked a question on the Amazon product page, but just got the usual collection of replies from people who don't understand that you're NOT SUPPOSED TO ANSWER IF YOU DON'T KNOW. Sheesh.So finally I figured out that I could contact NOW Foods directly (they have a question submission form on their web site), so I did that. They answered the following day. Here's their response:""The warning is based on legal settlements with attorneys that proposed the Prop 65 regulation for the State of California that mandates even low lead levels found naturally in the Whey protein be stickered. See our site on Prop 65 info: [link to the FAQ I mentioned above]"".So there you have it. California requires this label if there's a chance of more than 0.5 micrograms per day of lead in a product (I assume for this product they figure people will have one or two servings per day). Obviously it's still under the federal legal limit. The federal regulations seem to be a bit complicated, but for example, they seem to allow up to 15 micrograms per liter in drinking water. They allow 0.5 micrograms per liter (not per day or per serving) in baby food.So, basically, it's not a concern for most of us. Use common sense. Don't try to live on this and nothing else; the lead is unlikely to hurt you, but the lack of other nutrients will. It's a supplement, not a meal.I think this is an excellent product. Almost all protein powders have horrible extra ingredients for ""flavor""; with this one you're in control. I usually just go with a scoop of powder, a banana, and water for my post-workout shake. (Actually I only use about 2/3 of a scoop; I think they oversize the scoop a bit.)

I'm surprised by the taste of this whey. It has no taste at all, just like cold water. I've been using Nutrabio whey for 2-3 years, but when I tried this the first time I completely change my mind. I also go to its official website to compare the EAA's profile with Nutrabio whey, and the result turns out to favor Now Sport more as it has more L Leucine and L Trytophan in whey powder ( these 2 amino acids are the most important and expensive in the EAA's). So from now this will be my choice!Plus, I don't know why the price is so cheap compared to its website. 5lbs of Whey protein Isolate should be around $110, but Amazon is selling at $60-$70. This is unbelievable!

Yes, I am yelling it for all to hear that 1) Do not want or like sweetener in their protein powder, especially fake sweeteners or the natural yet awful-tasting stevia or monk fruit, 2) want a mild tasting, easy to mix/digest whey protein powder.I mix one scoop of this powder with 2T chocolate syrup (optional, only 100 calories, gives just enough sweetness & flavor), a cup of ice give or take, one cup of unsweetened original almond milk, in my little blender, for a protein-packed, 260 calorie, tasty, easily digested, chocolate shake.  Or I leave out the chocolate syrup, add in 1 cup of mixed berries & the other above ingredients, for a 230 calorie fruit smoothie.  Filling, refreshing, nutritious, tastes good!NO STEVIA, monk fruit, or any sweetener at all, mild whey taste, no aftertaste, mixes easily, digests easily, nutritious, what's not to love?!

Whey protein isolate is generally recognized as the most efficient and complete protein you can buy, so at least 3 stars for that alone.  This one gets 5 stars from me after using a number of other protein supplements that turned out to be less than pure.  After reading that much cited Consumer Reports article on protein supplements I narrowed my list of acceptable alternatives, and for years used Six Star whey protein; unfortunately like a lot of protein supplements Six Star adds a lot of things you probably don't need or want, including artificial sweeteners and way too much calcium and iron among other non- protein ingredients.  They recently increased the calcium content to about the same dose as Oscal, which would be great if you were feeding this stuff to your elderly grandmother with osteoporosis.  Healthy males in particular don't need all that calcium and iron, and considering that most people mix this in milk, and may take other supplements, say a multivitamin, also containing calcium, and add to that all the dairy and other calcium sources in your daily diet and you really end up getting way too much.  Both calcium and iron constipated you, and calcium in particular can cause bowel blockage.Anyway I speaking from experience I would recommend the purest form of protein you can find, without additives of any kind - the price is not high when you consider the size of the container and the quality of the product.  It is not flavored, but I find it tastes better than my old Six Stars chocolate chalk: I add a teaspoon of cocoa (Ghiradelli is good but any will do), a banana, a teaspoon of creatine (optional), a teaspoon of glutamine (optional but recommended), and 1/16 teaspoon of pure stevia.  I get the pure stevia from Amazon, the stevia at the grocery store is adulterated with all kinds of things, some contain dextrose (corn sugar) but still claim zero calories - how can that be?  Some have sugar alcohols, also controversial and not really calorie free either.  Get the pure stuff, it has no calories and tastes great, extremely sweet, a small amount goes a long way.  No one has a measuring spoon for 1/16 teaspoon, but you may have one for 1/8 teaspoon, which you can fill half-way.  You probably don't want more than that.

This is the lowest calorie, carb, fat content Whey and the best priced that I have found.  They do have flavors however I choose to use the unflavored so I can make my own.  I have read reviews of bad taste etc., really?  Who said to mix it by itself?  I mix 1 to 2 scoops of this in 3/4 cup 2% milk, pour a water flavor packet (similar to crystal lite) of choice in, pour into an empty water bottle.  Fills the water bottle about half way.  Take it to work with me, fill it the rest of the way with iced water.  I now have skim milk flavored as I choose.  If I want it sweeter I put a packet of Splenda in.  Do be aware that even though you are taking in X amount grams of protein there is a formula to determine how much you are actually absorbing so be aware of that when you make your choices.  Bariatric Advantage is the one of choice from my Doctor however it is expensive and now sold in 3lb containers not 5lb and I believe is $80+.  Also it is best if this is consumed over time to best absorb.  I have taken the specs to my Doctor to get the final approval from them.  If you are Bariatric do not be fooled by the cheapest product out there.  My surgery was done to avoid death from diabetes.  I am now fully controlled and on no medication of any kind.  ***NOTE***  I JUST RECEIVED CONFIRMED INFORMATION FROM MY DOCTOR & NUTRITIONIST TODAY 5-13-2014 (their words) ""You have not only found the lowest calorie, carb, fat content protein, but also the most absorbable protein on the open market out of 26 grams you are absorbing 24 grams of protein"" They did however caution this was not considered a meal replacement for bariatric patients due to the vitamins needed are not present.  Those vitamins could be added in powder form too.  They were impressed themselves with the content and what this product had to offer and will consider placing this on their list of acceptable protein for their patients!!  I will further say that they will not consider a product if they do not fully list it's content in every aspect and they deeply research a product you take to them.

I've seen people review and ding it for taste. It's straight whey protein. It has an inoffensive but distinct taste.  You ever mixed collagen with water? That's about what it tastes like. Is it bad? I don't think so. My usual method is to mix two scoops with milk and add a little water. It tastes like watered down milk. You can add coco powder or peanut butter powder to it and it will tatse like that. For the price when I bought it ($89) it's worth it. Quit being a baby.

NOTE: As I have only been using this product for 2 weeks, I cannot comment on its primary effectiveness as a muscle builder. I will post an update in 2 months time.I have compared this product to my old whey isolate which was made by Body Fortress (vanilla).Price (8/10):  this was my main selling point. I got this for roughly $60 for 5 lbs.  That's $12/lb. My old protein was $48/3 lb, about $4 more per lb. Seeing as I take anywhere from 2-4 scoops 6 days a week, it was adding up. While the price is lower than almost every other whey isolate I could find, it would be nice if it were under $10/lb, but I know I'm dreaming.Taste (3/10): yes, it's ""unflavored"", but don't take that to mean ""flavorless"".  I mix my pre/during workout whey with unflavored creatine and orange flavored BCAAs.  With my old vanilla whey, it tasted just like a Dreamsicle. But when I used one scoop of NOW, it tasted more like watered down orange Kool-Aid. When I use 2 scoops, it tasted worse, very chemically.  Even holding my nose didn't help because the metallic medicinal taste still hit my throat. I tried missing it with orange and pineapple juice, and that helped, but since I am my macros allow for only 25% of my calories to be from carbs, fruit juices are a tough addition. I may try Mio, something to even out the taste without adding carbs. But if you can afford the macros and calories, juice is your best bet.Mixability (8/10): for the most part this whey mixes pretty cleanly. I've used both a top filter shaker bottle and a wire ball shaker bottle with good success. Even with cold liquids there are no clumps. Very slight grit, but not sure if that's the protein or the creatine (probably creatine).Purity (9.5/10): you can't much purer than this. 25 g for 110 calories means per serving there are only 10 calories derived from something other than protein. Those calories are mostly BCAAs and soy lecithin, which is used to help it dissolve. Those are the only three ingredients, so not dealing with sweeteners or random fillers is a big plus for anyone who is cutting while trying to maintain muscle. Also, the high concentration of BCAAs is great, but make sure you are taking a BCAA supplement that gives you the proper 3:1:1 ratio because this one is half essential and half non-essential. Still good but needs a boost, especially post workout. I love ON's orange flavored 5000mg BCAAs. But that's a different review.Overall this is a solid product. Based on most reviews, I'm sure I'll notice the results soon.  Just too early to give an honest review of its ability to repair and build muscle but I have noticed I am leaning out a bit more. Again, not sure if that's the protein or mostly diet.  Either way, I am happy so far with this product, just need to work on the taste for my preferences.

This is one of the very few Whey proteins I can tolerate mixed just in plain water (for the substantial calorie savings over using juice or milk).I can definitely say this is the closest thing to ""unflavored"" whey isolate I've found & I use it to help keep energy levels high (and my normal blood sugars level) throughout the day.I have a mentally challenging job & find that protein helps me maintain mental energy all day long with no 3 PM slumps.I'm athletic & average weight, but definitely find that protein is a terrific energizer for me.  I'm definitely not in the ""low carb"" camp, but I do believe that reasonable protein supplementation has positive and tangible benefits.I learned quite a bit about the value of protein supplementation after reading 
Mastering Cortisol: Stop Your Body's Stress Hormone from Making You Fat Around the Middle
.  The author suggests that as we age, allowing blood sugar levels to run up and down (by skipping meals, going more than 3 hours w/o eating) can raise cortisol (the hormone) levels, leading to expanded waistlines and other baddies that can make that weight difficult, if not impossible, to lose.  Lower the cortisol & your metabolism improves* (*this is definitely an oversimplification of the book's great points--I highly recommend the book as a useful read to anyone over 35).If I'm eating a low-protein lunch, for example, I'll supplement with about a half a scoop of isolate in water just before eating.  If I have to go more than 3 hours between meals, I'll take another 1/2 to a full scoop. I also start the day with a homemade energy drink (protein, Vit C, lecithin, dried greens, 
NOW Foods Liquid CoQ10 Orange Flavor, 4 ounce
, etc.).If you can't take it plain like I do, use a teaspoon of 
Tang Orange Powdered Drink Mix (Makes 22 Quarts), 72-Ounce Canister
--gives it a pleasant ""orange creamsicle"" flavor.  If you're shunning carbs, sweeten with 
Pure Stevia Liquid Extract - 4 oz - Liquid
.Amazon's price is great on this high quality supplement; highly recommended for those who want to improve their fitness levels!

While not an expert on Whey I can only be swayed by what is written by the professionals who use the stuff in determining its effectiveness and all around value. First let me say that I have only had an opportunity to purchase 2 different Whey products, Gold Standard by ON and Now Foods Whey Protein Isolate. So going by taste the nod goes to Gold Standard, usefulness goes to Gold Standard, Mixable goes to Now Foods, Body of the drink goes to Gold Standard. So in all Gold Standard seems to be a more complete product. As far as pure whey goes Now Foods gets the nod. But to be fair I have not tried Now Foods flavored Whey. I have used both in Protein Smoothies, and Oatmeal. But because Now Foods has no additives I have had to doctor the Smoothies with nonfat dried milk to give it more body (it seemed a bit watery for me), sweetner, and nonfat greek yogurt and icecubes. The shakes are fine. Oatmeal in the morning consists of Oatmeal, dried cherries, sweetner, whey, and nonfat milk. The oatmeal is fine. Remember when comparing the two ON was complete and I didn't have to doctor it, Now Foods I did because it had no additives. Which is better? Who knows? I've been using the two a total of 6 months. With exercise and diet along with the Whey products I have gone from 268 lbs. to a current 218 and I am lifting and I am working out 4 times a week and doing cardio at least 5 days a week for an hour a day. One last note, should I reach my goal of 190-200 lbs. I will continue to use Whey products. So I don't think you could or would go wrong with either because they are both superior products. I chose Now Foods because of the purity of the product. However when I purchase again, I will buy the Now Foods again, but this time check out one of the flavored Whey products probably Vanilla. Hope this helps.

Five stars from me.  Already lots of positive reviews here so I'll keep this concise.1) Most importantly, quality ingredients.  Whey protein isolate provides, from what I can discern, the best quality to price ratio of any protein supplement.2) Mixes well and, and, for my palate, is indeed 'unflavored'.3) NOW is consistently responsive to inquiries about their products.In the Q&A section, you'll note that they state where they typically source the raw materials (Wisconsin) for this product.When they cannot source raw materials that meet their requirements, they suspend production of the affected products.  While that can be frustrating to consumers, it also tells us they maintain high standards even at the cost of losing sales.Also, they've been honest with me when I called with detailed questions about other products.  A couple times it was clear I was hoping for a different answer, but they simply told the truth rather than what I wanted to hear.Bottom line: NOW has integrity.  I think it's important to support companies with that quality.

Let's hit all the aspects: mixing, taste, and effectiveness.MIXING: This protein mixes very easily in my blender bottle. It is a little tougher to mix in a regular cup or glass just because you can't be vigorous enough with a knife or spoon without making a mess! If you don't have a blender bottle, I say pick one up immediately.TASTE: As others have noticed, taste is a little different. I would just call it natural. Another user noted that it tasted like powdered milk. This is definitely true. It isn't so much ""sour"" or ""rotten"" as some stated. However, it's all natural with no artificial sweeteners or other junk to cover it up. What did you expect?! On top of that, it's a dried product isolated from milk (the water left over from cheese production actually). If you've ever smelled cheese being made, then you should expect this flavor.Anyway, mix a half scoop with peanut butter and a chocolate powder of your choice and boom, delicious. I personally mix with milk and ovaltine (the original European formula is sugar free: 
Ovaltine Malt Beverage Mix 400g - Pack of 2 Jars
 ). So I say order some ovaltine to go with it if you can't handle it and maybe add some peanut butter. You can use less of the powder with the added protein of peanut butter and make the tub last even longer.EFFECTIVENESS: So far, so good. I will update if I have any issues.OVERALL: All natural whey protein.. it's exactly what it sounds like. The taste isn't fantastic, but can easily be masked by any flavors you like. The quality seems to be very high. I am switching over from ON products, which do taste incredible, but I couldn't be happier with my purchase. If you're putting this stuff in your body on a regular basis, then go all natural and get some quality peanut butter and cocoa powder from your local farmers market. You'll be glad you did!

Unlike the rest of the people that are loyal to this protein, like me, if this is your first time, then youre probably here because its a lot of protein for a fair price.That's just it, it is  lot of protein for under a hundred dollars. It doesnt include a list of different ingredients that I have no idea what effects they have on my body, it's just protein.That being said here is my review, it's gross, it doesn't taste good, not in the way that you cant drink it or you'll gag but I have found that even though I bought it and drink it daily, I don't wanna drink it because of the taste. It has nothing to do with the quality, it's just whey, I guess thats how plain whey tastes and it isnt good. Imagine powdered skim milk in water, it's like that. Theres no flavoring and no sugar to make it any better but this is what one comes to expect when you buy something that has no flavor, i suppose. Also once you shake it, it foams quite a bit, and the foam tastes even worse than the drink itself. So after i shake it, I let it settle as if it were a shaken soda or something. It mixes well, shaker cup or with a straw or spoon, no clumps.If youre looking for great protein, at a great price, with no additives, this is it. Look no further. Just dont expect it to taste like an ice-cold refreshing glass of milk, you will be sorely disappointed.

I love the quality and the price of the bulk product. It easily mixes with my pre-workout and post-workout supplement.I can I’ll say that for smoothies, the lack of flavor made me realize how much I was leaning on my flavored protien isolate powder for the subtle sweetness of vanilla flavored powders.A great buy and really inexpensive way to up your protien intake.Will definitely purchase again.

The best source of protein you can choose, as far as having a good balance of all the essential amino acids and lack of toxins is going to be lean meat or seafood.  Chicken Breast, Sirloin Steak, Sockeye Salmon.  Those are examples of real food you should consider eating before relying on protein powder.  That said, smoothies can be quick and convenient and often a good way to get your fruit and vegetable intake.  When you make smoothie it is often nice for it to have a source of protein and protein powder fits that bill very nicely.Whey protein isolate is the best protein powder you can choose.  Here’s why:Whey protein isolate vs concentrate.  Concentrate is cheaper.  Isolate removes the milk fats and carbohydrates and leave almost pure protein.  It is important to remove the fats not because all fats are bad for you, but because some types of fats probably are bad for you.  Milk fat contains approximately 65% saturated, 30% monounsaturated, and 5% polyunsaturated fatty acids.  Those 65% saturated fats are the ones most scientists believe are unhealthy.  Also the carbohydrates in milk include lactose, which a very large number of people have trouble digesting.  Because whey protein isolate doesn’t have the saturated fats and lactose of whey protein concentrate most scientists consider it to be healthier for you.Soy protein isolate is another alternative.  Soy is considered a complete protein in that it contains all the essential amino acids.  The main downside to Soy protein isolate is that it has a concentration of Saponins of 10.6 g/kg.  The full health effects of Saponins are still being studied, but several peer reviewed articles have shown Saponins to increase intestinal permeability also known as leaky gut. Leaky gut can cause low levels of inflammation throughout the body and other short term and long term negative health effects.In summary, Whey Protein Isolate isn’t quite as good as eating foods naturally high in protein, but it can make a healthy smoothie even healthier.

I have tried many protein powders and this is by far the best. It is not flawless, just better than the others. It has a good amino acid profile, a decent price, and it tastes good. No really, it actually tastes decent even though it is unflavored. I have tried many whey powders and they always have this revolting whey aftertaste. No amount of flavoring or mixing can cover that taste, but this powder doesn't have it to begin with. This is good, because it doesn't really mix as well as some powders. If you mix it with a spoon you will get some lumps. It's just that the lumps won't bother you, because they taste OK---not delicious, but palatable. It's closest competitor is Isopure which mixes better, but tastes horrible and is loaded with sodium (Isopure has 170mg of sodium per scoop, NOW has 45 mg, that's about 75% less.) Isopure also doesn't tell you its amino acid profile which is strange.The scoop that it comes with is baffling. It is a long rectangle that is just longer than the diameter of a glass, this means it is hard to transfer the powder into a glass without spilling. A really poor design. I may just use another scoop, if I can find the right measurement.One other thing: The bottle I got had a huge crack in it. I didn't notice it at first, but I wondered why there was so much powder on the outside of the bottle, and why it was partially empty. When I opened it I saw a huge crack in the side, that went from a dent in the side up to the rim. It must have happened at the warehouse, because the box was undamaged and it was packed well. The crack may explain the lumpiness if moisture from the air outside got into the powder. That could cause it to cake up. I won't lower my rating because Amazon resolved the issue to my satisfaction. They are so good about that sort of thing. I will definitely be ordering this stuff again.

I have been using NOW Unflavored Whey Protein Isolate for years.  The quality is always exceptional. You can tell it's the real deal and high quality just by looking and feeling the powder.  After you have tried several brands you can spot the difference.  One of the things I like about quality whey protein isolate is it will not give you horrible gas like cheap whey proteins do.  I like the unflavored one because I like to mix it with a  couple packets of single serving crystal light strawberry energy (has caffeine).  It tastes great and gives me my caffeine kick.  I change the flavor by changing the flavor of crystal light.  Been doing it for years.

I've been a fan of most of Now Foods products for the past 5 years.  I've used the creatine, l-glutamine, omega-3, and whey protein isolates.  I'm a 5'9 185lb male and lift weights 5 days a week and run 5 times a week.  I'm really glad I tried this Pure Protein product.  I used to use the Now Whey Isolate (Chocolate), but never cared for the taste and often felt a little queasy after an intense workout then a 1.5 scoop (40g) serving. I read about this product a few months ago and decided to try the 1lb tub for $22 to see how I liked it and how my body handled it.I used up the 1lb tub in two weeks, and it was fantastic.  I love that it truly is pure protein with no artificial flavors, no preservatives, and uses only whey isolate.  So many others cut their proteins with mixtures to save cost, and you get an inferior protein.  This stuff is really good.  I know many other reviews liked this product because it was unflavored and you could add your own flavor to make it taste great. For me, I don't want to spend the time making a recipe and cleaning a blender after my workout, so I mix it straight with cold filtered water in a tumbler with a fork.  It's very drinkable that way.  No big chunks and tastes like nothing.  I'm only drinking it to get my protein in, so what do I care.  :-)I've had no queasy after effects with this protein,  it mixes easy, and because of that I'm taking it more often and putting on more lean muscle.  I love the 10lb bag for convenience, and store it in a few smaller containers to avoid going into the resealable bag over and over. Solid product and I'll continue to buy.

I have been using whey protein as part of my supplementation for over 15 years.  I have tried just about every brand, every gimmick and even the generic brands.  The primary issue I have with 99% of whey proteins on the market is that they are filled with artificial ingredients and chemical compounds you can't pronounce. Even other ""all natural"" whey protein's such as Optimum Nutrition All Natural, Dymatize Elite All Natural, Jarrow Formulas, Whey Factors, Vitacost brand, etc. all have guar gum, xantham gum or xylitol or carrageenan in them.  I don't want any of those ""natural"" but possibly damaging substances in my whey protein.  If you do any research, all of those can cause serious problems with digestive health.  That is why Now Sports Whey Protein Isolate Unflavored is the best whey protein on the market.  It's nothing but pure whey protein isolate (the other ""natural"" whey's are blended with concentrate which is inferior to isolate and cheaper to manufacture).  This Now Sports Whey Protein Isolate Unflavored (I keep saying unflavored because the flavored now whey proteins also have gums in them) blends great and can be flavored to your liking.  I use this pre-post workout in my single serve ninja blender with half a banana, some almond butter and some glutamine.  Some reviews have said it has caused stomach discomfort - that is due to having trouble breaking down proetin's and protein powders that don't include digestive enzymes -  pickup some now super enzymes which help to break down proteins to help correct the issue.  In short, if you want an all natural whey protein, this is the best and most natural one you will find on the market today.  Remember to read labels and know what you are putting in your body.  As long as they keep making, I will keep buying.

When my trainer insisted I consume protein before my 6 a.m. training session I searched for a powder that wouldn't provide unnecessary chemicals, carbs, fat & cholesterol because who can eat @ 5 a.m.? Not me! Thankfully I found NOW Unflavored Whey Protein Isolate. I enjoy a protein ""smoothie"" every morning on my way to the gym.Although it doesn't always mix as easy as other products, using a blender easily remedies this. Plus, it is one of the few (if not only) protein supplements that does not contain added anything. Also, contrary to popular belief, this product is a fabulous weight loss tool b/c it supplies much-needed protein while being extremely low in carbs, which is perfect for those following a healthful weight loss regimen.For those who aren't fond of its taste, try being creative: Using a blender, mix one scoop protein powder (or two if you're a male body-builder), 8-12 oz water, a tablespoon of ground flax seed (aka flaxmeal), a pinch of Stevia to your liking and a few pieces of FROZEN fruit (any combination of banana slices, whole unsweetened berries, pineapple, etc.) and voila, you've got one tasty & healthfully nutritious beverage. Another of my favs: blend together one scoop protein powder, 8-12 oz water, a teaspoon or two of dry unsweetened cocoa powder (I like Hershey's Special Dark), a spoonful of instant coffee, a dash of Stevia to your liking, optional flaxmeal and 3 or 4 ice cubes and you've just made a lovely and nutritious ""frappuccio"" for a fraction of the cost to your wallet and no cost to your waist line. In addition to a pre- and post-workout protein fix, this recipe fits the bill when you've simply GOT to have something chocolate but don't want to ruin an otherwise on-track day.The only cons are (1) inabiity to purchase it locally; (2) not compatible for use in hot beverages. I'd love to be able to add it to my morning ""latte"".Cheers!

As other reviewers have said, this is a great value.  Although you can do the math and figure out how many servings this jug contains (81), the photo does not do justice to the massive size of this container.  Some people have said that it doesn't dissolve properly, but if you keep reading reviews you'll find that the key is to mix it into the liquid rather than mix the liquid into it.  I personally add this to my daily health shake (banana, milk, ascorbic acid, plus other items depending on what I want/need)...so I'm putting it into the blender...but I add it after pureeing the other ingredients.  Never noticed any bad taste (I don't think it has much flavor) and not once has there been any of it that is undissolved, and I really don't process the whey powder that long.  (Saw a video of an MD making a whey protein shake, and he gave it only around 5 seconds in the mix after adding it last.  Not sure if it makes a difference, but this technique works fine for me.)  I once also read that human milk is much higher in whey protein content than the cow's milk we consume, which is why I originally looked into this.  Just something to keep in mind.  While there are other brands of Whey Protein powder that may be higher rated, this one is unflavored and contains no sugar.  This allows for the greatest control over the final shake or smoothie if that's how you decide to use it.  I've added vanilla extract before and of course it tasted like vanilla!  Well, don't hesitate to buy this based on flavor unless you are a very picky eater.  In that case, I've got no advice because everyone's different.  Maybe purchase a smaller amount to begin with to see if you like it.  (This review is based on the 5lb. Canister.)

Review from a 25 y.o. female who exercises moderately about 5 days a week.I am a firm believer that carbs are from the devil and protein is crucial to your health and well-being. The cupcake addict (and nurse) in me can testify.25 grams of protein per one 28g (1/4 cup) scoop2 ingredients: Whey and Soy lecithin (Calcium, Potassium, Phosphorus, Magnesium as listed in the Ingredient list are not supplemented but naturally occur with whey)Now for the actual product review: UNFLAVORED WHEY 5 LBS1. You still get a mild, and I mean mild, whey taste when you mix it with your liquid in comparison to Optimum Gold Standard which has a strong whey flavor, in my opinion, regardless of flavorings.2. NOW Unflavored whey is tolerable if mixed in plain water if you hold your nose and chug really fast. My favorite way to drink it is with a little milk, peanut butter, honey, and banana for a 350 calorie/33g protein shake .3. I have not experienced any clumpiness. The product mixes almost instantly - it needs an encouraging shake or two in a shaker cup. I have not tried to stir it.4. I do not notice a thickening property, I've never mixed it with less than 6 ounces of fluid though (as stated in other reviews).5. This product is approximately $0.75 per serving. Take a couple fancy herbal supplements and a vitamin and it's still less than $2 per serving (eat that, Shakeology).6. Whey is the most bio-available and rapidly absorbed protein to date.I will purchase again.ONE CON: SOYSoy is another devil but its nearly impossible to avoid any soy additive in a protein supplement. Men: if you are looking for SOY-FREE try Pro7ein Synthesis by VitaSport.NOW foods is a GMP certified company with high quality products that I trust.

I’m a healthy adult, fit and I train a few weeks a week. I don’t have any health issues. I consider myself an educated consumer, I compare lots of products and I carefully review the nutrition facts of each product. I purchase the unflavored version of this product, and I have been consuming this protein for over 5 years. That said, this is my review about this product:PROS:- The unflavored version contains the most protein (25g) per serving (28g) I have found in the market. This is important to understand, you get 25g of protein per 28g of this product, meaning that fillings (flavorings, etc.) are only 3g. Review your protein and tell me if you get this much protein.- The cost of Now Whey Protein – Unflavored (under $100) is so far the best value I have found.- It mixes well and easily with different drinks and since it is unflavored, you barely notice it.- In the 5+ years I have consumed this protein, I have never experienced any gastrointestinal issues.CONS:- It is unflavored therefore lacks of any taste, but I guess this is expected.OVERALL RECOMMENDATION:- I definitely recommend this product, cost/value is probably the best protein out there.

Flavor reminds me of very weak powdered milk. Without the sour. Blends well with water, milk and yogurt. Great in orange juice. Does not add a strong flavor to already cooked food.

Quality: 5/5. It's a two ingredient whey isolate. As to the actual production process used, I have no idea. But based off of the amino acid profile, this stuff is legit. It dissolves well enough for a protein powder. Foamy you say? Wash your dishes a little better.Taste: 5/5. It tastes exactly as it's supposed to, like nothing. It's unflavored, best I can describe it when mixed in water is a bit of a chalky taste. I've added cocoa powder and stevia to make it chocolate. It's no where near as bad as some of these folks describe it. If you can handle an unflavored protein shake, put down the weights and go back to your safe place. You're not wanted in my gym.Value: 5/5. 5lbs right around $11 something a pound. It's not 2010 anymore and you can blame the huge increase in whey prices on Gatorade for introducing their sports recovery drink line. Economics 101 people, supply and demand. Crossfit probably didn't help either, oh by the way that's not a real pullup.Disclaimer: I started competing in weightlifting competitions when I was 14 (I'm 33 now). I've used 5 different proteins in all these years: 1. EAS...ok 2. MuscleTech.. crap  3. ON's Gold - 10+ years of satisfaction  4. NOW isolate 5+ years of satisfaction. 5. Muscle Milk - ok but too much sugar.If you're not worried about the carbs or extra ingredients get ON's Gold standard. If you want 25 grams of raw protein that's tasty, eat a steak. If you're like me and just need a quick no-carb protein boost and aren't a crossfit hipster, this is your protein.

This is a budget friendly option for those looking into a whey isolate supplement. Most whey isolate supplements are either a combination of whey concentrate and isolate or if they are 100% isolate they are prohibitively expensive. The powder mixes well with water and doesn't get chunky. As previous reviewers have stated the taste of this product is almost unbearable by itself. I don't know of anyone that would really enjoy drinking this without some form of addition to their shake. But at least you get to choose what those additions are without all the fillers and garbage that is put into most of the protein supplements out there. I usually add two packets of Truvia (Stevia sweetener) to my shaker bottle and it tastes just fine. I will sometimes add a teaspoon of PB2 powder for a change of flavor. Because it dissolves well in a shaker you will have no issues if you put it in a blender smoothie or something else. I have not attempted to use this in cooking or baking recipes as it seems like a waste for that purpose. I have not had any digestive issues with this product like I have had with some others which was a pleasant surprise.My only complaint is the included scoop. It is a large rectangle and therefore makes pouring difficult in all but the largest mouth shaker cups (ie. Classic Blender Bottles just barely work but the Sportmixer Blender Bottles don't have a large enough opening and will cause you to spill powder unless you use a funnel). While this is a small complaint it does seem like an odd choice as every other supplement uses a round portioning scoop.

After a lot of research this and one other 100% organic whey seem to be top-dogs in protein powder markets as far as specs and quality go, this includes all the modified types and creatine. FYI whey is far more neutral(healthier) than creatine, and these pure whey blends are the best of the best.I went ahead and got the 5LB at sixty bucks to save almost ten-dollars a pound. This is impressive as it economically beats every competitor and physical-retail price I've seen.I don't buy dietary and muscle building solutions based on taste and look like others, but this is better than most I've had.Also if buying based on marketing this and the other organic whey won't show up in your radar.. Trust me spec and health wise they are the best of the best, but feel free to spend days researching yourself. You'll see mostly powders with high ingredient lists and insane levels of marketing.I do 3 25g(84g protein) scoops in a low-cal no-sugar vitamin blend a day to go with 3 600cal high protein low-carb low-fat meals a day because I'm building metabolism with muscle to lose stored fat, after I'll probably do 4 with a lot of carbs and fat. It has 80 scoops in the 5LB, so do 2 scoops a day for 40 days or 3 a day for 26 days. It actually makes more sense to get the 10lb a save a lot of money.UPDATE: I do a 2200 cal. gainer every other day and conserve this since it has enough protein. This with cheap high-cal, high carb, high fat foods seems to be ideal for builders though..

This is a great option for anyone who is looking for a good whey protein isolate that is easily absorbed.  I am a bariatric patient and so I have to get in at least 50 grams of protein per day.  This will now be a staple in my pantry.  In the last year I have tried all sorts of protein; cheap ones, expensive designer ones, supposedly 'delicious' ones, but this one beats them all!  I love it for three main reasons:1. It lives up to its promise of being unflavored, in that it has has very little after/side taste. Anyone who says that there is a protein without ANY after taste is lying. I have tried a bunch of different unflavored ones including PURE by Inspire, and this is a better product. The great thing about a good unflavored protein is that it becomes anything you want, sweet or savory.2. It dissolves very well and is not prone to curdling in higher temperature liquids.  I mix it with a little cold water first and then I can dump it into a cup of hot tea or soup.  You still don't want to mix it directly with boiling water, but for the most part you can combine it with hotter drinks.3. The price is wonderful! This product gives you 25 grams of protein per scoop. I like this because I have tried other powders that claim to have a higher amount of of protein, only to discover that you need 2 or 3 scoops to get the amount of protein you need, so a container goes by fast. I ordered the 5lb container which has about 81 serving and will last me the whole month.  This is great value for money and makes the price of being healthy a lot less prohibitive.I am VERY glad I found this and I hope they'll keep producing it for a good long time.

I'd say this is closer to 3.5 stars. Better than 3 stars, but I can't give it 4.This is pure whey protein isolate. It has no artificial ingredients and is the unflavored variety. Now, keep in mind that when it says ""unflavored"", it doesn't mean it has no flavor. It just means it's not artificially flavored. This has the pure whey protein smell/flavor, which is like mild spoiled milk. It has nothing in it to mask the flavor. I have tried other unflavored whey proteins and this one doesn't taste as bad as the others.So, if you're looking for something with no artificial ingredients and no added sugar or sucralose, this might be for you. I've tried this in water, and could hardly get it down. But, if I put it in juice of some kind, it's bearable.It's a fine powder, but it does not mix completely (unless you use a blender, maybe). If you use a blender, it makes it foam like crazy. I personally just use a fork to mix it in. I'd say it mixes about 90%...and the rest kinda forms little pasty clumps. Not a big deal. I've actually discovered that if you use soy milk, it dissolves completely, instantly. I'm not sure why! And, if you want to use water, just let it sit for awhile and it'll eventually dissolve completely. I use water and just plug my nose so I can't taste it.It has 25 g of whey protein isolate pure 110 calorie serving, which is awesome. The nutrition facts are spot on. So, if you want a pure whey protein isolate powder and you're okay with just a few clumps and a mild spoiled milk flavor (which is a part of whey protein unless it's masked), this is a good product.As a side note, the 1.2 lbs container said it has 19 servings, with each serving being 1 level scoop. I did not get that many. I took one serving per day, leveled off, and it lasted me only 16 days. Weird.

I don't eat dairy unless I absolutely cannot avoid it -- not because it's trendy but because it actually really upsets my stomach.  But a friend recommended whey protein isolate as a ""safe"" dairy-derived protein powder to try, and it's true -- this product does not upset my stomach *at all*.  Everyone's different, of course, so consume at your own risk if you have issues with dairy, but I couldn't be happier.  I've been trying to work out regularly for about a year, and protein smoothies have become a big part of my daily life.  This stuff mixes into smoothies really easily and is basically flavorless.  You don't really even need a blender to mix it in!  My body has definitely changed (it has been about a year of lifting weights  and smoothies with a few weeks off here and there), and this powder has helped me manage my protein intake.  I think I wasn't getting nearly enough protein in my diet before, now I know the minimum I take in every day (I use 4 scoops of this stuff per day!).  This protein powder is WAY cheaper here on Amazon than I can get it locally, and it's also the best price for whey protein isolate here on Amazon.  I get it Subscribe & Save so I don't even have to think -- I just always have it on hand.  I can't imagine living without my smoothies now, I take a bottle to work or whip up a fresh one in the evening if I'm especially hungry.  Highly recommended.

This is my first time trying this product. It definitely has a taste, though not unpleasant. It tastes vaguely of vanilla, though I ordered the unflavoured kind. It is a fake vanilla taste.

Five stars. Because, just the few days I've used WPI - I now have veins popping out of my arms when other products didn't accomplish these same results, no matter how hard I've worked out and how long.I have much more energy now when working out, am now on the treadmill for 30.min up from 15.min and could run longer too  ... as if ... my muscles wasn't getting the right proteins from the other products I've tried within five years - now,  at 46 years, I have the energy and body of a 23 year old - the prefect sculptured body - with the help of my sweat suite I've invented. Flax Oil just came in today, now am waiting on my Hardcore Micellar Casein-4lbs to arrive. Everyone's bodies and metabolism aren't equal so, what works 4 me may not work for you, specially for those who haven't cut out meats from their diet. They claimed that WPI is not a weight loser, but I lost two and a half lbs in less then two weeks and am only taking it every other day.  I Am 5/6.FT and 156.lbs - all muscle, completely cut up all over because I eat .... very ... very, little or, I may eat a few peanut butter sandwiches and bananas the whole day and still workout. So, you got to go on how your body respond and react when taking anything, because we are all unique individuals with unique bodies so, listen mostly to your body then, to me or anyone else. I would recommend this product to all those who are serious bodybuilders - and not to someone whose looking for a magical pill or protein that will make them out of SUPERMAN! Your search is OVER!

I am mildy lactose intolerant. Regular whey protein (ON Gold Standard Whey) gives me terrible bloating all day long. It's very uncomfortable and takes a while to get the gas out. I also get gassy and bloated (but doesn't take long to gas out as whey) when I eat stuff that has heavy cream or mac n cheese. Some stuff will make me go to the bathroom bad. Just to give you an idea of my intolerance.I don't have any problems with this whey protein at all!! No longer do I have to choose between being bloated all day vs terrible chalky plant protein. This one does cost more than regular whey, but it is still cheaper than the fancier plant protein ones that aren't a terror to drink. It's worth the extra money to me, for the most part.. If you don't understand, this costs more because they filtered out the lactose. This is typically known as just whey isolate, but they hydrolyzed it to add more to the cost and take out more lactose and more. I wish they sold the larger version of the plain iso100, as it should in theory cost less since not hydrolyzed. I had not bloat problems with that one either, but the 5 lb hydrolyzed tub is cheaper than the 3 lb regular tub.. hydrolyzed protein is really only necessary for like pro athletes who need to be fine tuned as there's millions of dollars on the line.Taste is good, but not excellent. It is a bit too sweet, but I guess that's the American way. The regular iso100 is the best flavor for chocolate. The hydrolyzed version is sweeter, which is strange because this model should be marketed to athletes and those who are less likely to have sweets. I'm going to try some other flavors than chocolate. Hoping peanut butter chocolate is less sweet due to the peanut butter. The gourmet chocolate isn't that far off from drinking a liquid twix bar.

A little bit pricey, but worth it. This doesn't have a lot of excess garbage in it, it's pretty clean all things considered, other than some ingredients they put in for texture or mixing purposes. I am not crazy about all the flavors, but I thought the Cocoa Pebbles and Fudge Brownie were pretty good.My favorite thing about it is without a doubt the fact that it doesn't make me bloated and gassy the whole day compared to concentrates. I can't drink protein concentrates anymore after this. I drink a few of these throughout the day, and I am totally fine, no gassiness or bloating. So, if like me you are lactose intolerant, this brings an upset stomach down to like a 1/10, max a 2/10. That alone makes it worth the price, and some of the flavors are fantastic too.

I have purchased Dymatize ISO100 Hydrolyzed Protein Powder 4/5 times and I have to say that the taste is great, especially the Cocoa Pebbles flavor. It is a pure 100% Whey Isolate Protein powder which is fast absorbing and easy digesting. Each serving contains 25g of protein and 5.5g of BCAAs. It is also gluten-free. The only downside is that the price changes quite often, but overall it is a great product.

Loved the flavor and I ordered Cocoa pebbles next. The fruity pebbles one tasted just like the cereal although after a while I started to dislike it since I drink it everyday and it is very sweet.. I'm going to order 2 different flavors so that I can switch them up everyday next timeSo far I can see a huge difference in my workouts and I can do 1 hour cardio and 1 hour crossfit everyday for a month now thanks to this along with extra creatine ane collagen

I ordered the Fruity Pebbles flavor because it was the cheapest. Worried it’d taste like old cereal milk I was hesitant but glad I ordered. Great, fresh taste and the quality is top notch. All protein powders are now crazy expensive but I know what to expect with Dymatize and they never fail to deliver quality.

Drink Isolate protein for awhile and you won't ever go back to normal whey again. I went through it too quickly and bought the regular whey to fill in for a few weeks and I regret it. Doesn't fill you up and it absorbs much faster.  When drinking protein 4-5x per day the taste can get old but not with this brand. The taste is incredible, no weird aftertaste. Well worth paying the extra $$.

Tastes exactly like Cocoa Pebbles and it is the best tasting protein there is out there. Has great flavor and consistency.  I buy 5 lbs every month.  The only downfall is I been trying to eliminate sucralose in my diet but unfortunately this has it in it but not as its only sweetener so hopefully there isn't as much as other brands.  Dymatize is one of the best companies out there that makes protein and have been using their products for years.

The powder mixes extremely well with water and the flavor is decent. However, I can't recommend the chocolate flavor because it has a really strange taste that tries to be fancier than just plain chocolate. At first it was good, but I quickly began to hate the flavor. It's also overly sweet and I need to mix like 28 oz of water for 1 scoop just to tolerate it.Rating this a 4/5 since I don't think my personal opinion on the flavor should be the MOST important factor when rating this product. I will not be purchasing this again, but if I did I would definitely not get chocolate again.Note: I've had chocolate flavors from other brands that did have this same problem. I could drink those over and over again.

Love the Fruity Pebbles flavor...not the price.  The Fruity Pebbles flavor is the best I've tasted out of the many different brands and flavors of protein powders that I've tried.  I mix it with 8 to 10 ounces of skim milk.  I used to mix my protein powders with water until I tried it with milk.  Milk just makes all the flavors taste 10 times better.  I've tried it with skim (0%) milk, 1% milk and 2% milk and couldn't detect any big differences.  Since milk fat is not good for older adults, I stick to skim milk while my kids drink 1% or 2% milk.  Milk also adds 1 gram of protein for each ounce you drink.  So 8 ounces of milk mixed with 2/3 scoop of protein powder still gives you about the same amount of protein as 8 ounces of water mixed with a full scoop of protein powder.  It's just one way to make your protein powered last longer and save some money.  The only problem I have with Amazon and Dymatize ISO100 protein powder is the wildly fluctuating prices.  It could be $75 one day and $99 the next.On a side note, if you find this powder too fruity you can always mix it with a vanilla flavored protein powder to reduce the sweetness to your liking.

Remembering the old days of muscletech plus many other horrible chalky and sour  tasting protein powders, fruity pebbles and cocoa pebbles flavors by far, hands down, win any taste contest in my book. From the 25g of protein, to a 110 calories per scoop, it is amazing and overall a great protein. If muscle milk still made banana cream pie and birthday cake, before they went mainstream at every gas station truck stop sam's club, then I'd tell you to get them. Quest doesn't even compare to this one, and I like Quest. Tastes so good I thought I was eating the actual cereal in a blended form regardless of fruit or chocolate. Fruit loops should be the next flavor, or corn pops honeycomb something, I'd get behind those. A+ for me across the board.

By now I've tried both the chocolate and fuzzy navel flavors (my first review commented on vanilla only).  Both chocolate and fuzzy navel taste outstanding!  Highly recommended along with vanilla!  I now keep all three available to supplement my daily meals (vanilla, chocolate, and fuzzy navel).  I've been using the vanilla and chocolate much longer than fuzzy navel, but so far the fuzzy navel flavor is nearly addictive to my tastes (my craving for it may eventually pass, but so far I like it as well if not better than chocolate or vanilla).  The fuzzy navel flavor tastes close to vanilla with a very light touch of peach and orange added.  In a way the flavor reminds me of the ""lemon"" ice cream or frozen custard I ate as a kid; it really didn't taste like lemon at all, but was more interesting and tastier than vanilla.  The fuzzy navel flavor is so subtle you could probably use it in frozen fruit smoothies instead of vanilla (I haven't tried this yet) and not notice much of a difference (and this would allow you to reduce your inventory from three flavors to two flavors by dropping the vanilla).I am on my 3rd 5 lb container of vanilla, 2nd chocolate and 1st fuzzy navel. I often pack a lean lunch (including a small amount of animal protein, fruit and vegetable) and premix four servings of ISO*100 to take with me when I go off to work for the day (following something similar to BFL, eating a meal every two hours or so) and all flavors keep well throughout the day when premixed (or even keep well overnight).  I still prefer to mix on the fly when I am going to be around the house (see my previous vanilla review for how to chill your water with ice without blending any foam into your delicious meal replacement). When I start weight training again I will add two additional daily servings of ISO*100 (to bring daily protein intake up to one gram of protein per pound of body weight when including my two regular meals).It does not matter whether the IOS*100 you buy has a white or black plastic container, or whether what you buy is labeled as a ""gourmet"" flavor or not.  Don't pay more; if you hunt online price you should be able to find 5 lb quantities for somewhere around $60 or less.  As far as I can tell, Dymatize has replaced their old blends with new blends labeled ""Gourmet"" and part of that upgrade involves changing the container color from white to black.  The last time I ordered online, the picture of what I ordered showed a white container and did not include the word Gourmet on the flavor label; what I received in the mail was the black container with the Gourmet labeling.  My first two containers of vanilla were the old recipe in the white containers; and compared to the newer gourmet black container this older style vanilla was slightly ""grainy"" when thoroughly mixed compared to the newer ISO*100 products from Dymatize (my chocolate and fuzzy navel were ever grainy but these have always been in black containers).Regarding Dymatize's use of Sucralose; although you can find some limited negative press on this particular artificial sweetener, it is one of the most recently developed zero-carb sweeteners and considered by most authorities to be much healthier than earlier popular artificial sweeteners.  If anything better comes along in terms of ""health"" and ""taste"" I'm sure Dymatize will be quick to pick it up.  In the meantime, having a pure high protein low carb drink is a great convenience.  I still have not found a better or comparable product.  Thank You Dymatize and all the retailers selling this at affordable prices.

I love this stuff. Over the years I have used many different varieties of whey protein powder and suffered all sorts of stomach aching and bloating. I guess I am intolerant at some level, although I have never had an issue eating anything else. So, I was happy to discover the hydrolyzed version of the supplement, and even happier to find the Dymatize brand. No more discomfort and the chocolate flavor, for me at least, is great. I do not pretend to notice the difference in my lifting performance verses regular whey powder, but I definitely haven't noticed any lessor performance. So, I am way ahead!

I rotate between a few brands that I believe to be the most reputable in terms of protein quality based on Labdoor results over the years; Dyamtize is one of those brands. I haven't had it in awhile, but I'm not finding it to be just a tad too sweet for my tastes compared to some of the other brands.  It is a great value, though.

I have tried all kinds of protein from all kinds of companies and not found something that tastes as good as this! If you close your eyes you’ll think you’re a child again eating a bowl of fruity pebbles, it’s that good. They definitely nailed the flavor. It mixes really well with water and almond milk and has good flavor for both too. It is pricey so will not be my go to each time but definitely will continue using. I do not notice and uncomfortable stomach issues like with other brands. Highly recommend, hopefully I’ll catch it on sale soon!

I'm a bodybuilder so I go through a lot of this stuff in the off season.  As many calories as I can, really.  Just stuff em in there.  I have about 3-4 scoops a day so a 5lb tub lasts like 3 weeks.So, the fruity pebbles one was awesome.  Loved it.  It has that real nice fruity-ricey-sugary flavor just like the cereal.  The sprinkles are a nice touch. Took me right back to my childhood.  I drink a lot of this stuff so I have to like it at least a little bit.So I just got the Cocoa Pebbles one and it tastes basically just like the chocolate one.  It's not bad but I'm a little burned out with chocolate I guess after the 5 or 6 tubs of it I've already went through.Vanilla is fine.  Standard stuff really.  Can cook with it I guess...  So there's that.  Chocolate has a flavor that I think kinda reminds me of nesquick or Ovaltine.  Again, not bad.  But a lot like any other brand really.One thing I noticed between the hydrolyzed version versus the non-hydrolyzed is the amount of cholesterol.  75mg in the non, only 10 in the hydro.  Now this is weird because that is NOT standard for any other regular isolate to have that much cholesterol.  Not sure what the hell they put in there.

 I like the taste , dissolves easily with water . Like to buy it here at Amazon because it saves me around $20,  local stores prices a little higher. Will keep buying it . I have try the vanilla and fruity pebbles. Would like to try the banana but at the price of $160 🤦 not right now. Will recommend it. The 5 lbs bottle good for three months.  Great product 👍👌. Best protein in the market ( just my opinion) . Great taste. Wish it was cheaper. Fruity pebbles my favorite so far .

Overall, I'd say this is one of the best protein powders I've used. It has definitely helped me gain muscle while losing a bit of fat on the way. I've had 5 flavors so far: birthday cake, cinnamon bun, gourmet chocolate, choco peanut butter cup, and strawberry. All flavors have varying quality. I'll break it down below!- Birthday cake was way too sweet but it was pretty tasty. Mixed well and can't go wrong with it.- Cinnamon Bun mixed well too and tasted like milk mixed with cinnamon toast crunch seasoning. The flavor was a bit overpowering and not to my liking but it was not that bad.- Gourmet chocolate was the most neutral of them all. The taste was probably its biggest advantage as it is usually hard to go wrong with chocolate. Mixes well!- Choco peanut butter cup tasted more like straight peanut butter. At first I disliked it but after a few days it grew on me and I did not mind the flavor. Mixes well but I did find some weird residue in it.. also some days my chest would feel weird when drinking it. I would not say to steer away from this flavor since it was probably just an unlucky batch. Mixes well!- Strawberry is my most recent purchase. It was the cheapest of them all for the 5lb tub ($51 vs the usual $66). I read reviews of the strawberry not mixing well and having a weird taste. I can agree to the mixing aspect of the negative reviews as it does not break down well at all. I did find today after my workout that if you mix it and then add it to the fridge for a bit, and mix it later again it broke down evenly. I mixed/placed my shake in the fridge in between my main workout/ab workout and it worked wonders. The taste is actually my favorite. The after taste isn't pleasant but you get used to it!After my current tub runs out, I will not be using Dynamatize anymore due to other protein brands having similar quality and better competitive pricing. Dynamatize was my most used protein powder but I realized I go through a 5lb tub monthly which eventually had me seek out a new powder. I highly recommend Dynamatize though! It's helped me gain a lot of muscle which I find difficult due to my genetics/body structure.I should also mention that when I was deployed in the middle east, Dynamatize was hugely popular, often flying off the shelves the day it arrives at my base. Judging by that, it must be worth using!

I'm normally a fan of every Dymatize product. This product however makes me question it's authenticity. I could not for the life of me get the top off to get to the product inside. 45 minutes later and I had to resort to using scissors to cut the top off. Then after that, the protective seal under the cap would not peel off so I had to use the scissors again to get that off.Other than that, I really enjoyed this product.The taste is superb! I mix the powder with almond milk and it taste just like eating a bowl of Fruity Pebbles.Amazon has the best price you can find for this product. In stores it will run for about $20-$30 more.I would have liked to give this product 5 stars, but due to the difficulty of removing the top I had to subtract one star. Thankfully I had an old tub lying around and was able to swap those tops out. I feel bad for those who don't.

Dymatize ISO100 is the best mixing, best tasting, best digesting, and overall my favourite protein powder I have ever used. I can drink two whole scoops and even though I am full, it doesn't make me sick. Most of the flavors taste like a desert and it is usually never clumpy. I have been getting it for about 3 years now and have been through dozens of tubs.I will now rate all the flavors:Banana 2/5 - Not great, but not the worst. Tastes *sorta* like that fake candy banana flavorBirthday Cake - 0/5 Tastes like chemicles. nothing like the classic birthday cake flavor or the cerealChocolate - 2/5 Basic chocolate always sucks. This one is no exceptionChocolate Coconut - 0/5 Tastes like a burnt version of the regular chocolate which is especially upsetting when you are expecting an almond joy flavorChocolate Peanut Butter - 5/5 An incredaible combination and tastes like a dream come trueCinnamon Bun - 5/5 easily my favorite flavor, but they should have named it Horchata, because that is what it tastes more like.Cocoa Pebbles - 3/5 Not a bad chocolate, but it's not quite up to the actual cereal milk flavor they are going forCookies and Cream - 2/5 I don't think C&C has ever been good thoughFruity Pebbles - 4/5 Tastes just like the cereal milk! I love itFudge Brownie - 5/5 Tastes like an Iced Hot Cocoa. This is the first time anyone has ever gotten a 'plain' chocolate flavor right.Orange Dreamsicle - 5/5 Easily, my second favorite flavor. It tastes like a desert and I love it so muchStrawberry - 3/5 Its pretty good, nothing to shout about though (do NOT mix with banana. It's bad)Vanilla - 1/5 Does anyone actually like vanilla protein?

This protein is great!  So far, all the flavors I have tried is tasty.  It mixes extremely well with water and works great for smoothies.  My only gripe is the price per gram of protein and that it is extremely costly.  There are plenty of alternatives that will work better for most bodybuilders.

It tastes just like Fruity Pebbles which is surprising. It has a great amount of protein for one serving size. I have tried many bad-tasting protein shakes, so to finally have this is great. The only issue would be the price. However, with the price of it and the 72 servings in one container it even out to almost a dollar per serving.

So where is the value in ""ISO 100"" (Dymatize) protien compared to ""Gold Standard"" protien?I'll give you 2 good reasons, and 3rd ok reason this might be better for you1.) The Taste (chocolate)!-Gold Standard isn't bad, but ISO 100's chocolate flavor is noticeably louder, and significantly better in my opinion. I was not expecting how chocolaty the ""Gourmet Chocolate"" was going to be compared to Gold Standard's ""Double Rich Chocolate"". (Which i've been using for a good part of a year). It was like going from a mild Chocolate Milk to a rich (but thin) Chocolate shake. . Just 3-4 times more flavor.2.) Very little Lactose.- if you have an intolerance this should be much easier on you to consume :D.3 (for the few).) As far as which is healthier... -Technically ISO 100. Having single 1 ""whapping"" GRAM of protien per serving more than the competitor, as well as 1 less gram in both fat and carbs... really they are about the same nutritionally. For beginners to adept (even advanced) fitness people,1 gram isn't going to make much of a difference.BUT if you are on the level of Professional/Expert athlete that is super focused on being pinpoint accurate on your nutrition/diet and pumping iron at least 2x a day like a Beast! Then this could be significant to you.Overall, it's good but more expensive that Gold Brand with near identical nutritional value. ISO 100 in more of a luxury for its flavor, great for those sensitive to lactose, or for the few trying to fine tune a godlike machine they call a ""body"".

Before I got this, I'd been using a cheap-o product from Sam's Club that cost me around $45 for 5 lbs, and honestly I absolutely dreaded drinking it. I would mix it with water and choke it down as fast as I could to avoid tasting the sub-par flavor and feeling the undissolved lumps of powder slither down my throat as much as possible. Feeling a need for something better, I did some research and this stuff (the Dymatize powder) was recommended by a couple of websites for their high-quality flavors, and I decided that buying something that I actually enjoyed drinking would be worth the extra twenty bucks, so I gave it a shot...and...I will never go back. I got the fudge brownie flavor, and I almost immediately knew it would be better just from the simple fact that it actually completely dissolved in the water. I was quite happy to see that there weren't a bunch of globs of undissolved goo floating around in it after a modest amount of shaking, and it is very smooth to drink - maybe just the barest hint of grittiness but that could be the fact that I didn't shake it enough. The real star of the show, however, is the flavor. Unlike the other stuff I was using, this powder tastes absolutely delicious. In my opinion, both flavor and texture-wise the fudge brownie tastes EXACTLY like drinking powdered cocoa, and it's excellent. I now look forward to my protein shake. Rather than just choking down the entire thing as fast as possible to avoid the taste and texture, I savor each sip, and I'm even a little sad when it's gone. I am very impressed and very happy I spent the extra cash to get such a high-quality product. Oh, and upon receipt (since it came up so often in other reviews), I insured the container was sealed (it was), the container was full (it was), I looked for signs of bugs (none that I could see, but I'll keep an eye out), and I placed it on a scale that rated it at 5.2lbs, so everything seems to be in order on the quality assurance side of things. All in all, very good product, high amount of protein, low carbs, low calories, and the flavor is spot on. What's not to like? I think I'm just going to throw my old stuff out and drink this from now on.

I've purchased two of the 5lb buckets and I can say without a doubt, it's an exceptional protein powder. The first flavor I purchased was fudge brownie; I was extremely delighted with the flavor, and it managed to meet all my expectations including the ingredients I would want in a protein powder. The fudge brownie flavor was very palatable while mixing well with milk, water, and/or shakes. Unfortunately, the second flavor, cinnamon bun, I purchased was not so scrumptious. I have not tried any other flavors other than fudge brownie or the cinnamon bun so take my opinion with a grain of salt. To my disappointment the cinnamon bun flavor does not deliver as the fudge brownie did. Although it still mixed very well with any fluid and has a lot of great ingredients that I look for in my protein powders, the flavor was simply off-putting and lackluster. It's the type of flavor that I often tend to try and avoid when choosing which powder to buy, but I was feeling so very optimistic after the impression the fudge brownie had left on me I dubiously decided that I would take a leap of faith and try the forbidden cinnamon bun flavor. With high hopes and broken dreams I was yanked to the reality where my apprehensions came to fruition. Overall, the cinnamon bun flavor is tolerable AT BEST, and I genuinely mean, At Best. In conclusion, fudge brownie was a flavor I felt safe with, like a toasty bed on a frigid winter night. Whereas the cinnamon bun was a calculated risk. I knew the pay-off could have been legendary, but I was also aware of the looming price I may have to pay. You may ask, ""Why didn't you get a smaller size if it was a flavor you weren't sure of?"". To that, I must reiterate a distinguished saying from father gains himself; ""Just like in bodybuilding, failure is also a necessary experience for growth in our own lives, for if we’re never tested to our limits, how will we know how strong we really are? How will we ever grow?"" (– Arnold Schwarzenegger). I can say with a pump in my veins and a sight on my gains, I have grown from this failure. This protein powder not only changed my physical gains, but it has also changed my mental gains. I will take what I gained from this experience and keep it with me for the rest of my life. I can only hope you learn from my mistakes, and choose your flavor wisely. For in this scenario, there are right answers and there are wrong answers. No one lifters answers may be the same, so you must find it within yourself to ask with great caution ""Am I sure and am I ready to commit to this flavor of protein powder until the bottom of the bucket?"" May you pick wisely and with great confidence.Thank you kindly for your attention and time,  I wish you all the gains in the world.Michael BarnesProtein Powder Enthusiast

I used to be an optimum nutrition guy but when it comes to tastes and quality, Dymatize can’t be beaten!

Great protein powder! It mixes easy and tastes pretty good too.

I’m not sure what is driving such a large increase but I’ve been using this for many years. The vanilla is not sweet enough for me so I prefer the birthday cake flavor. However the price has doubled. I understand some increases and inflation but I’ve reached out to the manufacturer a few times and they only tell me to find a reputable place to purchase it to avoid higher prices. All places have almost doubled. I’ve been using another brand for now but I do love Iso-100 best.

I don't write reviews on Amazon so please upvote this, I've been very wary of protein powders, most of them are disgusting, this is the first one ever that has almost zero carbs, and it tastes just like fruity pebbles.

I've made recommendations to my friends who are all trying protein supplements, this is definitely the lowest hanging fruit, and I highly recommend it. I was worried too as the price is a bit expensive but for protein, you want to have the right mix. I'll leave another update 60 days from now based on my fitness and diet regiment to see if this has an effect.

A bit too sweet. 25g protein at 120 calories, I feel they could skip a bit of the sweetener profile. Mixes well even with ice.

...as you'll swear that you're having a bowl of Fruity Pebbles.  The first time I tried some, I almost instinctively ran to the TV to catch my favorite Saturday morning cartoon.  If the results are anywhere near the flavor, I will have done well.

!!2nd Updated!!Great taste, great quality, goes down smooth… after the FOAM settles. If you’re gonna drink this straight from mix expect a ton of foam. Even with water this stuff has a foam cap about an inch thick with every mix. I started mixing it and putting it in the fridge. Other than that minor inconvenience it’s gonna take a lot to get me to switch again.Update: results are still amazing! I’ve tried the cocoa pebbles and vanilla as of now. The cocoa pebbles is okay it’s not much different than any other chocolate protein as far as taste goes it is amazing with a little added PB. The vanilla is by far the worst tasting of the three. I was happy to get through the vanilla so I could switch to anything else. The vanilla’s foam was insane too!2: the foam from the fruity pebbles has become unbearable! It had made my protein consumption time go from moments to around 15 min waiting for this foam to settle if it ever does. On top of that the bubbles have been cause awful GI bloating and discomfort. I’ll be searching for a new brand until you can get that foam under control.

So this is definitely the best protein ive tried to date. My only issue is it is sweetened with splenda. I wish they would sweeten it with monk fruit, but I can live with it. Ive only tried the Cinnabon flavor and its actually on the verge of being sickening sweet. Some people will love that, but I have to find ways to tone it down. Ive been mixing whats left of my optimum nutrition cause its not sweet enough and it balances out. Ill try other flavors once im done with these two tubs.

One of the reviewers here is correct about large producers packaging their whey isolates under a variety of different brand names, but I was only able to find a few hydrolyzed whey proteins offered from all the products currently available online (there are many).  I only found a few similar to this one with the distinction of being hydrolyzed which is presumably easier to digest and contains the highest available percentage of protein.  A 28 gram serving of this product contains 25 grams of protein or 90% protein by weight.  I have been buying whey protein powder for more than 15 years and used all the popular brands.  This is simply the best whey I have ever used and tastes different than any others I've known up till now.  Zero fat and zero carbs per serving.  I no longer use or recommend soy isolates and while I have found some good quality brown rice protein powders the taste is so unpleasant I would stick to whey.Since I was recently new to this whey product, I always start by purchasing vanilla since that's usually the most difficult flavor to do well (in my experience).  If I don't like the taste, vanilla is always good to have around for adding to fruit smoothies (a smoothie easily overwhelms any subtleties of an objectionable vanilla whey flavor). If I like the taste of their vanilla I'll serve it solo as well as in smoothies.  Once I know I like the vanilla, chocolate is usually next.  This vanilla is excellent as far as vanilla goes and I'll be ordering more flavors soon.  I use a VitaMix to quickly and easily mix a tasty 12 ounce serving.One trick I can pass along for making a delicious glass is to start with a 16 oz measuring cup.  If you have a crushed ice dispenser in your frig door put a few ounces of ice into your measuring cup and fill with water up to the 12 oz mark.  Dump the ice and water into your VitaMix and blend at high speed (the idea being to make the water very cold while making any evidence of the ice disappear).  With the VitaMix still running at the slowest rpm (stir speed) quickly add one scoop of this protein powder into the freezing cold water and run another 10 to 15 seconds.  Pour into a glass and serve while cold.  WOW!  Is that Good!  I don't like running the blender fast with the protein powder already in the water because it makes a foamy drink I don't find enjoyable.Great for diets, snacks throughout the day, for feeding your muscles after weight training.  This is a great product.  If you are looking for the highest quality whey isolate at the best possible price, this 5lb size is your lowest price best value deal from all comparable labels (at least at the time I'm writing this review).  Be sure and shop price because I you can easily pay more than twice the lowest available prices.

This product is by far one of the best whey isolate protein powder that I've ever taken. If you're someone who works out regularly, this product is the product for you. It mixes almost instantly without any lumps and powder residue at the bottom of your shaker bottle. I know some of you are afraid of protein powders that don't mix well with certain beverages like milk or juice, but ISO 100 blends in such a way that leaves no clumps in whatever you choose to mix it with. In comparison to ON's Gold Standard Whey, this product mixes way better than ON. As a person who has purchased ON for the past 2 years, I can advocate for that comparison. I've tried many other protein powders in the past, with my most purchased being ON's Gold Standard Whey, that product was my favorite before trying ISO 100 but now I think I will switch my product loyalty to this product, and I think so will you.If you're like me and you go to the gym at least 4 times a week, you might be in need of a product that contains a significant amount of BCAAs that aids recovery and BCAAs fuel your skeletal muscles during training, which can help give you the edge you need to push your limits. The 2.7grams of leucine supports the activation of protein muscle synthesis which is key to muscle growth. You also want a product that is low in calories and one that doesn't bloat you, this product only has 120 calories per serving and it doesn't bloat you at all. You will not be disappointed in this product at all, I've been taking it for a month and I've seen significant growth in my body in just the span of 4 weeks. But of course, the results vary from person to person and not everyone will notice growth in the first 4 weeks. However, you will be surprised at how this product makes your muscles leaner and your strength will improve gradually as well.As for flavors, personally, I've never strayed away from anything chocolatey tasting, but you guys might have different taste preferences. So, if you are planning to purchase this product, I would highly recommend the Gourmet Chocolate flavor as it doesn't taste too generic and it goes down easy. I would rate the Gourmet Chocolate a solid 8/10, you might feel differently about the taste but that's just my opinion. I don't do any other flavors besides chocolate for protein powders. This product surpassed my expectations by a mile, I thought it would be inferior to ON's Gold Standard Whey, but it turned out to be significantly better in my opinion.I would 10/10 recommend this product to anyone!

This product is used by some of the best bodybuilders in the world- including a glaring endorsement by the famous Dave Palumbo- a legend in the sport.  This is a product used by people who measure everything they eat, obsess about every gram of carbs and protein they ingest and who - by rigorous trial and error- discover ways to change their body composition that defy belief.  The way I see it, if organic bodybuilders who look like a million bucks swear by this product, and knowing how much they consume on a daily basis (thousands of high quality calories daily), then it's going to be good enough for me.  And sure enough, I've been through several jugs of this already, and I am LOVING it.DISSOLVES INSTANTLYI put in two scoops+8 ounces of water, and it completely dissolves.  I stay busy and have to supplement my protein intake and so I take 3 shakes a day.  I love that I don't even have to use the metal wire-whisk ball that goes in my shaker cup.  I just add about 8 ounces of water, and stir with an ordinary spoon for about 15 seconds.  It barely changes the consistency of the water (no thickening agents), and goes down easily.  I drink the vanilla because I love the taste- not too sweet, and no ""off"" flavors or aromas.TASTES AWESOMEI've used 40 or 50 different protein supplements, and the worst has to be the protein supplements derived from vegetable matter.  I've had protein powders that literally tasted like chalk dust.  Dymatize has a winning product here with the taste being so simple, smooth, and free of surprise odors or aftertaste.  It's just really REALLY good.  My 12 year old son keeps swiping shakes when I'm not around because he loves the taste.HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTI'm using this product to help with putting on muscle.  So far, I've had great gains in quality muscle, and I can drink this stuff at any hour (even late at night) without getting any kind of indigestion.  It's top notch quality.ABOUT THE SELLER:I got my product VERY FAST, packaged properly, and there was even a little extra sample product thrown in there for free.  How cool is that?  You don't even see that kind of thing any more these days.  I was delighted.  Thanks for the sample!  You have my ongoing business, and my 5 star rating.  Please don't change anything!

I use this about six times a week, one scoop per day in ~12oz water, along with the typical 5g of Creatine and 5g of fiber. I use an electric milk foamer to integrate the powder (avoids clumps of powder sticking to roof/mouth of shaker cup), then shake it in a shaker cup to fully emulsify. This produces a nice, even consistency a little less thick than a vanilla shake.Flavor-wise - inoffensive. A little protein bitterness but really not much at all, not too sweet, not too creamy. Better than most of the sugary brands out there. No aftertaste. Clean the cup well, though, because this is the kind of powder that will leave an odor if your aren't reasonably thorough.Comfort-wise - no discomfort if you take it after your sets. No gastrointestinal distress of any sort, no bloating. Decently filling on its own, and quite acceptable with the fiber.Effect-wise - well I'm plateaued at 183 and have been for a couple years - this didn't change that at all. But it maintained well and isn't to calorie-heavy, so no complaints I suppose.Cost-wise - worth the price for what you get. Doesn't have the same protein/dollar ratio you can get with some brands, but the flavor's better, which for someone like me, who is content to maintain mass and support the sets, it's fine.Give it a try if you haven't already, but otherwise unremarkable.

First of all, it tastes great!  Probably the best tasting isolate I've had and seems to work effectively.  However, it should be noted that there is a Bioengineered food ingredient statement that has been omitted from the online ingredient label, so this product does contain GMOs.  Some people don't care, some do... I feel it should be stated for transparency.  Also, I think the product weight and/or the indicated servings per container (about 71, it says) may not be entirely accurate.  I drank one level scoop per day with my workouts, and the container I received was gone in a month.  @71 servings, it should have lasted over 2 months!  Could just be the container I received was shorted somehow, these things happen, but this product is quite expensive... if I'm paying for 71 servings, I better be getting at least close to that amount, not less than half of it.

I’ve been lifting since I was 14 and I’m now 26. I’ve had about every major brand/flavor of protein powder you can imagine over the past 12 years. You could go to GNC or VitaminShoppe and pick a random protein powder off the shelf and chances are, I’ve probably had it. When I say this is the best tasting protein powder I’ve ever had, I mean it. It literally taste like drinking the milk after a bowl of Fruity Pebbles. Honestly, I’ll probably never try another brand/flavor again unless for some reason the ISO100 Fruity Pebbles becomes unavailable. It doesn’t always mix the best and sometimes you might drink tiny bits, but that’s a minor problem IMO. Unfortunately, it’s outrageously expensive like the majority of protein powders these days. But, if you can afford to pay the extra money, and like Fruity Pebbles cereal, I 100% recommend trying this.

Honestly if you're looking for a new protein powder to try that's a good mix of value/quality, just stop looking at get this. Out of all the protein supplements I've tried this has quickly become my favorite.  Great price (especially when you get the bigger tubs), crazy macros, amazing taste, and dissolves better than any protein powder I've tried. My only regret is that I didn't start getting this protein powder sooner. You can't go wrong with this. Below are the reviews of the flavors I've tried so far:Fudge Brownie: 10/10 my favorite flavor by far. As far as I'm concerned, this is the perfect protein powder flavor. Mixes well and tastes just like hot cocoa powder mix. I'd drink this flavor even if it didn't have protein in it.Cookies and Cream: 7/10 doesn't taste bad but really doesn't taste like much at all. This flavor is really weak but it doesn't taste terrible like some protein powders so it's pretty easy to drink I just wish it had more cookies and cream flavor.Birthday Cake: 4/10 I thought this flavor was decent the first few times I tried it but I got sick of it pretty quickly. It doesn't really taste like birthday cake it has kind of a weird vanilla flavor that I don't especially like. Also the tub that I got didn't mix as well as other tubs so overall it was my least favorite of all the flavors I've tried.

The flavor of the gourmet vanilla is incredibly bland which some of you may think is a downside but honestly for me that is fine because it makes it very easy to mix into smoothies or add things to it.As for price it may seem pretty expensive for a 5 pounder but that is honestly just how it is for pure isolates.Not my favorite flavor but you can easily add stuff to it to make it a lot more tastey.

For starters, I've been buying this product for MANY years now. I was always happy with the product and would have given this product a 5 start rating until my last purchase. After opening the box that the container arrived in, I noticed trace amounts of protein power in the box and on the container near the tear off safety seal. I then removed the tear off safety seal and removed the lid. I was shocked to see that the container didn't have an inner safety seal on the container. Like I said, I've been buying this product for years and the container ALWAYS had an inner safety seal on the rim of the container that had to be peeled off. My first thought was that the product had been tampered with so I contacted Dymatize support and let them know that the container didn't have an internal safety seal. I communicated with 2 people and they both told me the same thing. Once response was, ""Yes, we recently transitioned to a foam inner liner that creates a seal with the pressure of closing the lid."" The other response was, ""We included a foam liner in place of the typical paper liner. The foam seal is not adhered to the container. It creates a seal by the pressure of closing the lid. We are doing so with the same care and commitment to quality that has made us a trusted leader in the sports nutrition industry for over 20 years.""Dymatize in my opinion has always been a top-notched protein powder which is reflected in the steep price customers have to pay for their protein. For customers like myself who've been with them for years, I have a VERY hard time understating why they would decide to stop selling their protein with an inner safety seal. They're telling me that the quality hasn't changed, but I beg to differ on that because the fact that I saw trace amounts of protein on the container and in the Amazon box BEFORE opening it pretty much proves the container wasn't air tight.

I originally gave this product 5 stars, because at $99 dollars it was a great deal.  You were basically spending what it would costs to buy 3 1LB tubs in the store, and getting an additional 2 1LB tubs.  Due to the popularity of the Vanilla flavor, they have upped the price to $115.  It's a shame when a greedy company does this to a product.  Their other flavors are still below $99, and some around $91, so it has nothing to do with manufacturing.  If you can sell other flavors for $91-$99, then you can do the same with Vanilla.  I'll change my rating when this becomes priced reasonably again.  I'm changing to a different Protein brand.  My original review is below.Original Review:This is the best value I've found, because a 1LB tub in the store is $33, so with this option (5LB) you're basically getting 2 pounds for free, compared to if you purchased 5 1LB tubs in the store.  This is a good mixing protein, I can mix 4 scoops in a shaker with 16oz of water and it mixes in fast and easy with no clumping - after 30-60 seconds of vigorous shaking.  The flavor is good, but I'm not very picky on taste.

Make your smoothies even healthier with a natural whey protein powder that does not contain sugar or artificial sweeteners.Garden of Life Organic Grass Fed Whey Powder is the best tasting organic protein powder I have tried. It blends well whether I am using a blender or Nutribullet. Just for fun, I put together a blind taste test using the same smoothy but three samples: No protein powder, Garden of Life Organic Grass Feed Whey Powder, and a popular Muscle brand. Using small paper cups four friends blind sampled each of the three. Each person received samples of all three but the cups were in different orders for each. Both plain and Garden of Life tied for taste and Garden of Life come out on top for a bit more ""mouthability"".

I like this protein whey and it may be the only one that does not impact my sleep or hurt my stomach. I was using it for some time and last time I bought it for 17$ from Amazon fresh but now it became 43$ which means 150% price increase all of a sudden. For the size of this powder, the price is extremely huge now. I will be on the new protein powder hunt again.

This is everything you could want in a whey powder. It's certified organic from grass fed cows. Jersey cows no less, which are known for producing outstanding milk. I trust the advertisement that the cows are out on pasture at least 300 days a year. That's important, because 'grass-fed' as a marketing claim is not regulated by the USDA, so you have to dig deeper to find out. This whey is also a concentrate, which some people may not prefer, but it preserves all the natural nutritive compounds (in their natural ratios) which heavier processing to create isolates can destroy. The chocolate is certified fair trade, as well as raw (this is the difference between cocoa and cacao, which has additional health benefits over cocoa). And the product is even humane certified! There are also no added sugars, and the addition of bifido-lactis assists with digestion, which is a very thoughtful addition that makes this whey stand out.I disagree with reviews that identify erythritol with producing excessive gas and bloating. Although it's certainly possible one could be sensitive to erythritol, it's much more likely that gas and bloating came from introducing a new strain of probiotic into the gut. I think this would be especially true for someone who has a poor gut microbiome. Also, whey is known to cause gas and bloating itself, partly since it is so easily assimilated by the body. Hence the bifido-lactis. This product did make me gassy for several days, but then my body adapted and it doesn't cause me any issues.

I was looking for a good quality whey protein concentrate.. without added chemicals or artificial stuff.. when I found this product I enjoyed the vanilla taste very much. It's sweet enough but not overly sweet if you're like me and mostly avoid sugar as a lifestyle. It blends very easily, quickly and does not leave clumps or residue. My only issue is that at $28 for 13oz it just not realistic for a lot of people. And it's annoying needing to order a container every 9 days.. and that's taking the recommended dosage, some people prefer a little more. I ended up finding Levels protein here on amazon and picked up a 5lb container for under $60 and its quality/taste/everything is comparable to this one. This Garden of Life product comes out to cost about $30 per pound and now Levels is costing me about $11 per pound! And I don't have to order all the time! I would have stuck with this company but I just can't stay loyal to the hefty price and lack of larger sizing options. My new option features the same type of quality testing from a third party company and also has similar levels of bcaas. Not trying to sound like an advertisement but there are other options out there!

This whey is pretty good but the problem that I have is that I have a super sensitive nose and the smell of vanilla is, for me, very strong and that turns me off.  The flavor is good.

I’m allergic to stevia—this is not uncommon as anyone with a ragweed allergy has a high risk of being allergic to stevia, too. It’s so hard to find non-stevia protein powder. I love that this has just a little sweetness but also doesn’t have a specific flavor, so I can add it to anything and it works. It mixes great— even though I lost the shaker part of my shaker bottle, it wasn’t grainy or clumpy. I added a tablespoon of plain unsweetened cocoa powder and it worked great to make a chocolate flavor (I used milk in that one). I’d love for there to be less sugar in it, like 8 grams instead of 11, so instead of using two scoops I use one. Overall I’m really happy I found this. Glad to have a portable post-workout option other than peanut butter.

My son is competitive swimmer and needs the extra protein and calories. I really wanted a less processed form of whey protein and Garden of Life is the answer. (He has been using their products for a couple years now). He mixes 2 scoops of protein in with his organic frozen fruit smoothies. Adds some organic orange juice, organic spinach and organic yogurt (yes, organic as much as possible). It is ton of protein and carbs, but when you swim 16+ hours a week and also have gym training, the kid needs it!!  It is a little pricier because he's using a tub every few weeks, but he likes the flavor and it's healthier for him. Highly recommend!

I really wanted to love this! Grass fed? Check! Organic? Check! Non-GMO? Check! Solid amino acid profile? Check!So where did this fall short and why will I not order it again? It contains too many sweeteners: Erythritol AND Stevia?! I usually add some fruits (strawberries, bananas, blueberries) to my shakes and veggies (broccoli or cauliflower), but with so many sweeteners already added, it was just impossible to drink this with the sweetness overload.So, I had to resort to drinking the shake on its own without any fruits or veggies added, and even then, it was just too sweet! Why do we need all of these sweetener alternatives? It defeats the purpose of a wholesome diet. Just get rid of them and keep a clean product.I would love to see an unsweetened vanilla flavor, just pure vanilla, no nonsense sweeteners added. Or also an unflavored version that's simple.

Going beyond taste this is by far much better than another leading brand shake which has 8 grams of sugar where this only has 2 grams.  Other positive comparisons are 21 grams of protein compared with only 15 grams, total carbs are only 7 grams compared with 15 grams plus this one has 2 Billion CFU Probiotics where the other one only has 1 Billion.

I've tried quite a few whey protein powders and this one is my favorite.  Besides the good ingredients, the vanilla flavor is delicious, it blends easily and doesn't taste gritty, it doesn't taste overly sweet, and doesn't have a weird aftertaste.  I blend it with ice, half cup of frozen berries, spinach, and water and it's such a delicious treat that keeps me full for a few hours.  Highly recommend!

The chocolate flavor is well balanced and not over the top. The product is sweet enough to mix with yogurt or into a smoothy. It goes particularly well will overnight oats or chia for breakfast. Consistency is best when blended with yogurt or frozen bananas, and not just water. It takes a little time to mix up completely. I like purchasing Garden of Life Whey protein as it is organic, which I consider important for all animal products.

This powder dissolved easily and quickly.  However, I rarely use any type of sugar and the stevia in this left an aftertaste that lasted hours.  I used it a couple of days to see if I'd get used to it, but it was just too much.  I received a refund and gave the powder to my friend to see if she could tolerate it.  I bought Impact Whey Isolate Unflavored instead and it is fabulous!!  No taste whatsoever and easily dissolves.

I love this brand. The best value for the money bar none in my opinion. I can get huge quantities, with quality protein, decent flavors and good prices.I use the regular MuscleTech during the day and at night, right before bed, I mix up one of these bad boys. Let me tell you, I was VERY skeptical since I'm a die-hard chocoholic and generally hate vanilla but this vanilla was the best value and I decided to give it a chance.I've been on a cut and pounding the weights hard to maintain muscle mass and strength during the cut. I wanted to maximize protein/amino acid volume in my blood and protein muscle synthesis. So I figure getting a long-acting protein like Casein during the sleep ""fast"" would be a great way to do this.The good news is the protein tastes great by itself and occasionally I mix it up by tossing in cinnamon or cocoa powder or powdered peanut butter and I'm on my way to flavor town. I get an upset stomach, bloating, and gas from some powders, but not Casein. It was gentle on my gut and during this diet cycle I not only lost weight and fat, I seem to have gained a little muscle and everyone is commenting that my back and shoulders and arm actually look bigger, not just due to fat loss, but greater peak and volume and lat spread. ON A CUT! I'm no mass monster by a long shot but it's a great feeling.Just for reference I am 186cm and cut 5kg from 100kg to 95kg and was hitting the gym 4 to 5 times a day, walking cardio 6x a week and a short jog 3x times a week and roughly 1.1g of protein per lb of body weight (or 2.42g per kg if my math is right).Highly Recommended to tweak your MPS (muscle protein synthesis) to a higher level during your training cycle by taking advantage of the benefits of slow digesting protein during your 8 hours of sleep (the 8 hours or more is  KEY for growth and recovery).Good luck!

Chocolate flavor tastes good to me, but I'm pretty flexible on tastes.  I usually do a half scoop along with some other brands mixed in for a post lifting shake.  Definitely like to grab it when it's on sale.

MuscleTech products have always been high quality and this one is no different -Tastes great, mixes super easily in water (powder is super fine, which can get messy though if you're scooping with abandon) and is sold at a good price point.After several months it seems to work just as well as any other powder I've used, and the casein does help you feel full for a while afterward.

Of all the protein powders I have tried, 8 Hour Protein ( formerly called Phase 8)  is definitely at the top for quality, value and price.  Pretty good vanilla flavor (recently name changed to Vanilla Cake) and relatively straight forward ingredients. Definitely have seen results when taking it after workouts and at times before bed. A good in between meal snack as well. Mixes well with water or milk.However, It used to come in a large jug. Was easy to handle, scoop out and seal with the lid. The company recently changed the packaging to a large sack that is supposedly resealable. It is awful. You require scissors to open the package as there is no starter notch or perforation. The resealable zip lock does not work. It is cheap thin garbage. Try pressing it shut and it does not close and the fine powder goes airborne and everywhere. Messy. The jugs were better but they must be cutting costs. Surprise surprise.

What used to be called MuscleTech Phase8, and is now MuscleTech Platinum 8-Hour Protein, has been my go-to protein supplement for years. Great specs, good flavor, easy to mix.The new name came along with new packaging. Rather than being a large jug, one that I could actually get my hand in and scoop the powder out, it now comes in a flimsy plastic bag. I can understand cost-cutting measures. I could live with that...not happily but, hey, also less volume in the trash can.However, if it was a cost-cutting measure it clearly failed. January 2020 I paid, through Amazon, $32.95 for the 4.6 pound jug. In January 2022 that had risen to $41.60. But now it's $60.46? Seriously? We now have a cheap plastic sack instead of an easy-to-use jug and the price has gone up a whopping 45.3% in just 8 months? I'm paying almost TWICE AS MUCH for it as I was in 2020?Great specs and good flavor, but I have to find a replacement product that doesn't require I take out a second mortgage. At $60.46 per, if you take one serving twice each day that's an annual cost of $883. Not a typo. If you take 4 scoops daily per MuscleTech's recommendation for maximum results, that's now a price tag of $1,766 per year.So I give it 5 stars for the product itself, and take away two stars for the new packaging...and especially the new price.

I usually hate how Casein tastes but this one is actually quite good and perfect for before bedtime protein for those long hours sleeping. The new package in bags is also more convenient that the 5lbs pots they used to ship in a couple years ago.Even though it does taste quite good there is still a small aftertaste and also, it was an ok deal because I bought it on Prime Day but at the regular price and because of that little aftertaste I think it deserves 4 stars. Still good though.

The Positives:- This is one of the more calorie conscious protein powders I've seen. One serving has 26g of protein for only 150 kcals.- No issues with the ingredients used to create the protein powder!The Negatives:- The powder is TOO FINE. Whenever you open the bag or any sort of storage container, the powder flies out at you in a small dust cloud of whey. This also makes it difficult to fully mix into beverages...still get that nasty, grainy texture.- The bagged design with a ziploc-style seal makes it more difficult to open the package, and increases the likelihood you lose some protein powder over time with consistent use, given how light and powdery the formula is. Every time I open the bag to scoop some out, I lose some powder.- The taste. Look, I know flavor is not most people's #1 consideration when purchasing protein powders, but for me, this chocolate flavor is not good. Have had comparably much better flavoring in other protein powders.

I've had several vanilla flavored proteins and while most of them have been good, this one is by far my favorite. It's great with milk and also blended with fruits, like bananas. The powder is extremely fine, more than any other protein I've tried, to the point that it blows out a bit like dust when I open the package. I think a bottle would have been better for such a fine powder than a bag. But it's no big deal, just gotta handle carefully. The ultra fine consistency probably helps with mixing, though I always use a blender so I don't know how well it would mix without one.

I guess it is just me but I cannot stand the taste of it. I have to literally chug it and then I feel like throwing up because of the flavor. I hope it actually helps grow muscle and that's the reason I am chugging it in. If there was a way I could return it after trying it one time, I would do it. I have tried a lot of protein powders as I am a student athlete and I have been playing tennis and hitting the gym for past 11 years and the taste of this protein powder is one of the worst ones I have ever tried. I seriously hope it helps my body otherwise all this sacrifice of my taste buds will go in vein.

Who decided to put it in a bag? I've been putting Whey and Casein in my shake for a while now. Whey for the immediate and Casein for the longer term. But I've stopped buying the expensive stuff as I have seen no difference. I saw this on Prime Day and thought I'd try it. And it IS good. Great flavor, etc. But a bag? I just opened the bag and could have been arrested. The contents flew EVERYWHERE. And the ""zip lock"" is basically useless. So I closed the bag, pressed out the air and put it in my cabinet. And when I pulled it out of the cabinet the next day? Boom! It was everywhere. I had to vacuum my kitchen floor. Again, great powder. But who decided to put it in a bag instead of an inexpensive tub?

I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing how incredibly thin this powder is. It makes a cloud when I open the container and covers everything in a three foot radius with a thin dusting of protein. Usually the thinner the protein powder is to digest and absorb. However, I've never had a protein powder so thin I'm afraid to breath on it and accidentally blow up a huge protein cloud. Scooping too vigorously stirs up the powder so much I usually have to go back with a sponge and clean up the countertop.It turns to sludge if it's not shaken or stirred immediately after touching water. I would suggest not even trying a fork or stirring. If you use a shaker cup the clumps are soft and easily obliterated with shaking. It mixes better than any other protein in a shaker cup or blender, very smooth. However, its impossible to stir it into liquid.I feel like the claim it's slow digesting is truthful, usually if I mix it with some maltodextrin and fiber I feel satiated for a few hours and don't have hunger pains like I do shortly after ingesting other protein like ON Gold Standard.The vanilla flavor is amazing, I mix it with walnut butter, almond milk, oat and wheat bran, psyllium and maltodextrin to make a meal replacement gainer drink. Blended this is the absolute best tasting mix I've come up with, this is the only vanilla that doesn't leave a artificial sweet taste in my mouth.3-stars for the mess5-stars for everything else, my favorite when compared to: Muscle Pharm Combat, ON Gold Standard, and Syntha-6

UPDATED REVIEWI have stopped using this product. The price has gone up some and the quality has gone down or become inconsistent. It's not terrible, but there are better products out there with similar formulas. I have dropped my rating from 5 to 3 stars, but 2.5 stars is probably more accurate.My main issues are that the powder is so fine that it goes all over the place when getting it out of the container. And it is not that easy to dissolve. The taste for the vanilla version I used is maybe OK to chalky - varies from container to container. They have also increased pricing somewhat - though to be fair, prices vary depending on where and when you look.I now use Syntha 6 in regular or Edge version. I think they cost a little more usually, but don't  have the problems of the muscletech product reviewed here.ORIGINAL REVIEWI have tired both vanilla and chocolate. They both tasted pretty good - the vanilla tastes like a very good malt, and I liked it a bit better than the chocolate.I use half milk and half water as the base and add the powder while stirring with a spoon. Easy to blend. The vanilla looks more agreeable when blended. The chocolate not so nice looking then.I like that it is sort of a time release protein. It keeps the blood level steadier than plain whey protein. I drink one serving first thing in the morning and another before bed. I do use a regular whey product during the day. Trying to get 150 - 180 g of protein a day and would not be able to without protein powders.One downside of the Phase 8 product in vanilla is that it can be quite difficult to find - here or at a local store. Not sure why that is. The company should up production.

I was real disappointed to see that Phase8 is no longer available and now it is this thing.This new one says it is the same but a different look, which by the way is much much worse than what Phase8 was. Also, the taste is NOT the same at all. I get the chocolate and Phase8 was great, this is not as strong. When I mix it, the powder remains not completely mixed almost like it's a little grainy.

This looks like a powder but once you actually put it in a shake (and then in your mouth) you realize that there are small little chunks that are pretty hard that stay in your mouth. It really grosses me out, actually, and I’ve never had a protein powder like this. It’s my first time buying this brand so I’m not sure if it’s normally like this or if they had a quality control issue with my specific batch. Either way, I’m turned off enough that I wouldn’t even consider purchasing this brand in the future. Disappointment. If you can get past the small chunks I appreciate the milk chocolate flavor but do feel like it’s sweeter than it needs to be.

I've been using muscletech brand sups for years now. They always seem to have the better textures, better flavors, minimal aftertaste, lower prices, better quality, more effective supplements. I mean I've tried so many other brands. I used to mostly buy musclepharm, but honestly I feel like these products are much better. The whey protein (milk choc) has an amazing flavor and is actually enjoyable to drink. I'm a bodybuilder, and I've been able to get pretty big and pack on loads of muscle. Pretty sure this protein does nothing but help. People tend to leave reviews about sups saying things like ""who cares about the flavor, just choke it down and enjoy gains"". Honestly, after so many years of supplements, the ultimate deciding factors for me are performance, taste, and aftertaste. If you're going to ingest something daily and virtually religiously for years on end, for god sake, make sure you're able to damn stomach the stuff. Like i said, muscletech, and particularly this whey shake, is amazing. Scrumptious flavor, little to no aftertaste, easy mixing, and high quality muscle building protein.However, I will mention that every other tub of whey I encounter tends to have some strange ""hard bits"" in the powder. I have no idea what they are. Can anyone inform? @seller ?? They don't dissolve in liquid, regardless of how vigorously you shake or blend. It's kinda gross, but it's so rare that I see no reason to start the search again for another post workout recovery.

After I started consuming this protein powder I experienced these issues:1. Nausea and lightheadedness: I am sure that my condition is not due to anything else but this powder; I had never experienced such conditions before and these started happening to me right after I started consuming this powder;2. Stomach and intestines discomfort: your stomach/intestines will produce a lot of gas throughout the day; this powder is super-bulky and therefore you must mix one scoop of it in a lot of water otherwise you will be drinking a semi-solid past;Moreover, you would not like the taste and texture of this in your mouth.

Dealing with the bag that it comes in is not very fun, it’s like handling a bag full of concrete, every time you open it dust goes everywhere when you close it dust goes everywhere when you scoop it out dust goes everywhere, protein powder dust. And after mixing it in a ninja blender there were some small particles that were still a bit chunky and chewy

This is not the first time I’ve used this exact product.  After my last container of this protein drink was empty (which was purchased in a brick and mortar) I wanted to get another.  I was very happy with it the first time.  However the container I received from my Amazon order wasn’t overall as good.  First, there was no scoop in the container.  The directions say to use a scoop so you would THINK it would be included.  Thankfully I still had the provided scoop from my first one.  Second,  it didn’t mix very well.  Not sure why but I couldn’t get this powder to mix nearly as well as my first one.  I was always left with lots of chocolate chunks that would mix completely.

The vanilla flavor is great and blends incredible well with just a shaker bottle! Additionally, the slow release casein protein definitely helps me feel full longer compared to a previous protein powder I was using. The cost is incredibly low for a mix of this quality and quantity! I definitely feel like my workout recovery time has been improved by using this product. I was spending a lot of my time sore and struggling to get a full recovery between workouts (which was lowering my work out performance as I fought through soreness and fatigue), but after getting this protein blend with some immediate recovery benefits (from the whey isolates) as well as sustained recovery benefits (from the casein blend), my workouts have been progressing as I had hoped! Can't say enough good things about this protein performance wise and flavor wise. Be warned though, since the powder is so fine (for ideal blending ability) it is like a fine dust and if you are not very careful, you will get the fine dust all over your counters/kitchen scooping in a hurry. So just take your time and you will love this protein!

It is a good protein power with okay taste profile. I usually get MusclePharm blended protein and in the past I have used mainly OK whey protein. I wanted to try MuscleTech Phase8 to rotate the protein powders.MuscleTech Phase8 has protein, glutamine and BCAAs. Compared to MP and OK, MuscleTech Phase8 protein powder flavor is not very appealing. The flavor, while not repulsive, felt a bit more synthetic, with water and milk, both.I may order other flavors in the future, eventhough, I prefer blended proteins over single source proteins.

Short of putting this in a blender, it's nearly impossible to shake this well enough to get rid of all the chunks.This is true even when the concentration is low and it is mixed with warm water.Otherwise, it has solid taste, nutrients, and price.

I got this for a great price, and it has BCAAs, and some other stuff, Glutamine and whatever.  It’s good for recovery.  This has the same stuff in it that some post workouts have in it so it saves me from having to buy post workouts.  This really goes super tasty 😋 with whole milk 🥛 at night.  I hope they keep the price down.  I got mine for like $20 and change with the coupon and a subscription.The vanilla with whole milk 🥛 tastes like a vanilla milk 🥛 shake 🥤.  I do 1/2 scoop with 12oz of whole milk at night.  I’m not doing script strength training or I would use a whole scoop.  I usually take a whole scoop with 12oz of water after an hour jog or an hour of cardio/body weight/strength/stamina military style exercises.

This is amazing. The flavor is spot on wonderful and very filling. I use a blender to blend it up.  I ordered vanilla and it taste like cake batter. There is absolutely no gross fake sugar taste or fake chemical taste.

Tried the triple chocolate flavor of this product, it actually mixes a lot better than I thought it would. I put two scoops in 1 cup of milk it mixes very well.  The triple chocolate is not bad in my opinion and it does not have a bad aftertaste. MuscleTech is known for making well made products and the Phase 8 protein is no exception. I'll say that this is one of the better proteins that I have tasted from MuscleTech and I think that this product is worth the money.  The results you get from Phase 8 protein is equivalent to that of similar products from other brands, only this one is more affordable. This is a great protein for after workouts, especially with the hydrolyzed whey protein isolate and the casein protein for the slow digesting at night. It doesn't hurt your stomach like the other protein product can. I would recommended this product to my friends and colleagues.

I've tried a lot of different protein powders over the years, I am certainly no body builder so I can't attain to the effectiveness of the product long term, but I will say that the vanilla version of this one doesn't taste good. Even compared to others this one has an odd taste and grainy texture. I've tried water, skim milk, whole milk, adding cocoa powder, matcha powder, even tried cooking with it and you just can't get rid of the strange taste it has. I was getting the ""nitro tech"" powder from them before and it wasn't bad, I thought the vanilla might be good to mix with other things and it seemed like this blend might have been better possibly, but I think I'll probably just go back to the nitro tech instead next time.

I am a fitness instructor. Have been working out consistently for years. Have had different types of protein powder, switching it up almost every time. What I like best about this product is the price point. Can't beat that. I also like the texture/thickness of the shake. Definitely feels more fulfilling than others, especially if you use water to mix with your shakes. The only reason why I give this 4 stars is because it does feel chalky no matter how much i mix or shake it. I feel like I need to cough or clear my throat after drinking. The flavor is just okay but I dont drink protein shakes because I like the taste. Overall would recommend at least once but I dont think I'll buy again.

I always read reviews on protein powders that complain about the flavor. It's a nutritional supplement, not a milkshake. It is meant to serve a purpose, not entertain your taste buds. With that said, the ones who say the chocolate flavor tastes horrible are crazy. I've tried MANY protein powders over the last decade and chocolate is always my default flavor, and this is probably the best tasting one so far. And even though it is mostly whey protein with a little casein thrown in, it does seem to keep me satiated for a long time. It also mixes way easier than pure casein, which is nice. Aside from the useless claims of ""making your muscles bigger and stronger"" and all the BCAA garbage that you get from regular food anyways, this is a solid product.

I tried the Premium Gold 100% WHEY PROTEIN (Vanilla Ice Cream) from Muscletech before this and it was a much different consistency and flavor. The Vanilla flavor of PHASE8 tastes more like chemicals than anything, and the consistency is like trying to mix sand with water (very grainy). The previous product was much more chalky and mixed way better. I bought this for the price, which was about $10 cheaper than most other brands, so I can't complain too much if it still does the job. I'm not the type of person to waste things, so I will finish the tub, but I won't be buying PHASE8 again. That extra $10 seems worth it now. Lol. I also might try to avoid Vanilla flavoring in the future since most companies just can't seem to get it right.

The reason for me buying this is that it has 26 grams of protein per scoop with only 150 calories each. Compared to what I was taking before, the Syntha 6 powder with 23 grams of protein at 200 calories, I figured the trade off is worth it. The price is what it is, but at the end of the day these giant jugs of even just decent protein powder isn't going to necessarily be dirt cheap.So that's the good part, the bad part is the taste, or more specifically the after taste. It's good first going in but when the after taste is just bitter and medicine like with a bit of Vanilla flavoring. You can KILL the after taste with a spoon full of peanut butter which makes it taste WAY WAY better than it would without it, plus peanut butter adds more protein, so as far as I'm concerned it's win win.I realize a bad after taste maybe a non starter for a lot of people, but like I said, the protein and calorie content per scoop is what I'm basing my value proposition on, so take that how you will.

Taste wise, this is my favorite protein powder by far. The ingredients leave a bit to be desired as we're trying to find that perfect balance of a good protein powder, taste and optimal ingredients. The final downfall is we're watching our carb intake and 8g of carb per serving is way too high for day to day.If you're objective is fantastic taste and quality whey protein, this is a stellar protein powder.On the other hand, if you're fine tuning your carb intake and seek a higher quality protein powder with minimal additives, this is not for you.3/5

Kept me full as claimed. I didn't like the Sucralose sweetener that this has, but didn't find out till I had it in hand.  I would prefer no sweetener than what this has.I would not order again.Some simple research revealed Sucralose is not good for you, its manufactured by combined  sucrose (cane sugar) and chlorine, yeah that's right,, drain cleaner and laundry whitener, and its these chlorine atoms in the chemical makeup of sucralose that is killing your good gut bacteria  Sucralose alters the amount and quality of those beneficial microbes that hang out in your belly (the same ones found in yogurt) by 50% or more. “Alteration in bacterial counts is associated with weight gain and obesity,” and limits you body's ability to process certain therapeutic medications. Sucralose can be up to 1000 times more sweeter than cane sugar and its more stable for enabling a prolonged shelf life. Its this reason manufacturers like to use it, Their cheap and a little goes a long way so they choose the coin over their customers health.  Why not make it without the sweetener as an option.

This is not the 8 hr protein. It is thin and more like milk and water consistency.  In the past it was fine.  This is different. Some companies change their product to a cheaper quality when it sells well. The consumer is not stupid.This is my last purchase of this product.

Really easy to mix.  No chunks, or nonsense left over after shaking it up.  It tastes really nice.  I like adding a half scoop to my overnight oats.  Perfect sweetness without tasting artificially or sickly sweet.This has given me a little gas, unlike Syntha 6, but it's not a prolonged thing or a big deal.  Sweeteners do that and you'll react to some and not others.  Find the right one for you.  Overall, this makes a really nice, filling shake.  I'm using it as a meal replacement for lunch, or a filler between lunch and dinner if it's going to be a long day.

Tried this as a cheaper alternative to Gold Standard. I guess it all depends on what protein you're coming from. Having tried a few different kinds, from the GNC generic brand to the cheap stuff from Wally World, Gold Standard seems to be fairly top tier in regards to taste and quality. I could taste the artificial sweetener immediately in Phase8 where as I couldn't with GS. I 'think' GS uses a form a stevia as to sweeten their whey so that's probably the big difference. That said I did get used to the taste, I was just concerned I wasn't going to be able to finish the tub at first.Also, Phase8 is a PITA to mix. With GS, I can use a spoon to stir it up with water and milk and it come out with very little to no clumping at all. I had to use a shaker at all times with Phase8, otherwise I'd be choking on huge clumps of powder. Also, it's crazy how ""powdery"" this stuff is. Dumping a serving into my shaker created a cloud of dust every time. I know that's a pretty nit picky but it's nice not to have to wipe down the table after every protein shake.You could probably do worse at this price point. So it gets two stars as it is tolerable if this is what you can afford. On a side note, as I was going to order more GS, I discovered Amazon has finally, thankfully, added it back to their Subscribe and Save program. That just made it tons more affordable and that's what I'll be sticking with for the time being.

I'm an evening lifter, and even though I do use a protein supplement after the workout, I've noticed that this does seem to help with fatigue and recovery when I take even a smaller extra shake of this before heading off to sleep. I have to say, I don't love the flavor, but it is bearable.

Since I generally only eat once a day at dinner, I wanted something more substantial in the morning than just my coffee, and this is my go-to daytime protein boost. In hot coffee, it's a little clumpy if it's not thoroughly mixed. I've found that it's best if I put the powder in the cup first, add a few ounces of hot coffee and stir it up to almost a thick uniform paste-like consistency, then continue adding the rest of the coffee while stirring. I generally use a large 20oz mug for my morning coffee.UPDATE - I just ordered one in the vanilla flavor and it has a bitter, chemical-tasting aftertaste - definitely not happy with the vanilla and would not recommend.

1. Pour milk/water in your shaker cup. It helps stop the powder from sticking to the bottom of the cup.2. Put a scoop of protein powder in the shaker with a blender ball. You have NO hope of making this shake without a blender ball.3. Get a spoon and spend the next 10 minutes scraping powder off the sides of the cup.4. Scrape the powder off the spoon. This stuff just cakes on there like dried oatmeal.5. Wait for your clumpy concoction to get to room temperature. This stuff does not like to mix in cold milk.6. Shake vigorously for 35 minutes, then open the lid of the shaker cup and scrape all the dried powder off the lid.7. At this point, the shake will have the consistency of pancake batter. If you add about 8 gallons of water, you'll have something that's more like chocolate pudding.8. Choke it all down. It can take a while, but I always power through.9. Be disappointed at how much protein powder got stuck to the bottom of the cup.10. Repeat after every workout.Yeah, the taste is OK, but it's totally worth spending another $15 on a better protein. I've been a protein shake drinking gymrat for years, and I'm not even going to finish this container; I've already ordered a better product.And yes, I followed the mixing directions on the container.

Muscle Tech has created an amazing protein with the Phase 8 blended formula. For those who regularly workout and for those who don't, this is a must go to protein that consists of seven sources. It is low in calories and carbs compared to other proteins which make it ideal for a meal replacement shake. The blended protein definantly helps with muscle recovery.  The taste is fabulous too (well as good as a protein supplement can taste) and it mixes very well. I personally get the Vanilla flavor and mix it with vanilla almond milk - unsweetened and vanilla almond chocolate milk to change it up. I highly recommend this product to individuals looking for both a meal replacement and muscle recovery protein. Plus, Amazon has a great price on it!

I love this protein. It is lower carb than most others and tastes great in water. Usually I have to add milk to get a good flavor out of protein, however this stuff somehow tastes great in milk. I also like the fact that it is sweetened with Splenda, my non-nutritive sweetener of choice, as I am a diabetic.I also like the fact that it doesn't have soy protein. Soy protein increases estrogen levels in men. Estrogen is not what I am looking to get out of a protein shake. All in all, excellent product, I'll be back for more so long as the price is right.

I'm really fond of MuscleTech's ""Whey Gold"" line, and the vanilla flavor there. It's some of the best vanilla whey I've tasted. I was hoping for more or less the same here, anticipating some slight deviation given the added ingredient and benefit list here.Unfortunately, I'm guessing due to whatever additive pack or filler they're using to hit the advertised supplement list, the flavor is pretty awful. It leaves a kind of off-coffee aftertaste. That said, I've tried a different brand's whey+creatine mix product, and this one does a better job of masking the aftertaste. Still thoroughly unpleasant though, whereas Whey Gold is an absolute treat to drink.

this is not my favorite powder... i have to say that much. it breaks down ok, if the container you start it in is slightly wet at all the spots it sticks to when pouring in are very hard to get to mix. drinking this is like.... drinking sand paper? its very gritty. compared to other proteins i'm not considering this to be extremely worth its while. another annoying part is scooping and pouring this powder... I haven't had a powder that responds like this one before. If it pours out or clumps out that is, all at once, it poofs up a death cloud which then some how instantly settles onto whatever you're wearing or wherever you're mixing it. normal protein you can get a hand in the powder on accident, no big deal. this protein will stick to your hand like you dunked it in water prior to reaching in the container... overall i'm displeased. but it's protein and it works so i'm fighting through the annoyances because why would I throw it all away.

Been using this protein for about a month, not a bad product no stomach issues at all no bloating. One little thing that bothered me is the residue that it leaves at the bottom of the shaker which is a pain to wash out after, no matter how much time I shake it, I mix one full scoop with a full bottle of water (16oz) which is double the amount indicated on the label but still have that issue.

Phase 8 has a good list of ingredients but I wouldn't say that it it mixes well with anything. You can get it to mix with milk (good) water (mehj) with a LOT of vigorous shaking in a blender cup. The label says you can use 2 scoops in 14fl oz of water which sounds like it would require a lot of wrist action if that's your thing.The flavor is fine - not as good as others like Designer Protein but this is a protein shake not a delicacy. On the plus side it has a decent amount of protein and a good combo of other ingredients.

BSA is generally a higher than average brand marketing to serious to semi-serious athletes - so keep that in mind when you order. It's not top of the line, but you're not getting garbage either.On to the Syntha-6 specifically: taste is top notch and hard to beat. Ace-K as a sweetener, along with the other fillers, aren't great for you, but they're in almost all other major brands so it's hard to avoid. The additional 10g BCAAs are a nice touch, however, you don't know which amino acids they're packaging and at what doses - is it effective???Unless you go to higher end brands, you're going to get proprietary blends and you won't know the dose of each ingredient. That's just something you have to be willing to accept in this tier of supplements.Having a protein blend is great as research suggests that when you add medium-digesting (egg) and slow-digesting (casein) proteins to fast-digesting whey, muscle protein synthesis remains elevated for longer and muscle protein retention is higher. Not many recovery shakes have a protein blend, especially at this price point. Downside to Syntha-6, we don't know how much of each protein source there is.The sodium and carbs are a little high. This makes the nutrition profile more like a meal replacement than a lean protein source.Biggest question is does it work? I would say yes, it outperforms many of the protein shakes at this price point.Overall, the pros definitely outweigh the cons. This is a solid protein shake that tastes great.

Mixes well with milk, Texture is a bit different since its a whey/casein mixture then pure whey, But its very drinkable, I mixed it with a scoop of Boost Vanilla to get my needed vitamins in as well as protein for breakfast, Im just a normal non body builder type looking to replace breakfast meals with a shake. This fits my needs.Taste is a generic vanilla, I can't tell the difference between it and boost vanilla powder, The after taste has a slight very slight cardboard flavor that dissipates pretty quickly.Overall its a 4/5 its my 2nd protein powder I've ever tried, with Ghost Whey being the first and preferred. But this is good too.Will have to try the cookies and cream flavor to get a lil chocolate in there.UPDATE: Picked up the 5lb jug of the vanilla, I've learned to love the taste, and the digestive enzymes they add REALLY HELP With the Gas/bloating issues other products may provide, this one does not give me gas or bloating!! LOVE THIS PRODUCT!

I think the company makes good protein but the chocolate peanut butter missed the mark. The taste is drinkable, not bad, not great. What I don't like are the black specs throughout the protein. I have no idea what they are and I was worried I received fake product. After researching other who bought the same flavor I did find reviews with the same black pieces in theirs. They do not blend and are hard. Wish the company would would clarify it had chunks of something in it and exactly what it was.

This is by far the best protein shake mix out there! I was skeptical because I'd tried many over the years. I was introduced to this and havent (AND WON'T) looked back! I put a banana and a tablespoon of peanut butter with about 1/4 cup of water and ice and its almost heaven. I look forward to getting home after work and making a shake. Its calming and just overall a great way to end a hard day! Its VERY fulfilling. I have added about 3 tablespoons of oatmeal to it on days when I hadn't eaten. There is no need for sugar and/or sweetener. I liked it so much that I purchased the strawberry flavor also. So far I dont like it as much as the vanilla ice cream flavor. I think I need to continue to try adding things to the strawberry flavor to see if I could be a fan of it. But for now I'm 1,000% sure ANYONE would love the vanilla! I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!! THANK YOU SYNTHA-6!!!!!!!!

Best protien shake I've had yet.I burst with energy after having it-my body really likes it, but my taste buds like it the most!I got the vanilla ice cream flavor and it's delicious even with just cold water. I add 2 scoops of raisins too it and eat with a spoon, and wow is it ever good like this!No other protien shake makes me feel as good. Maybe placebo? Dunno, I just know I'll pay the price difference to get this over body fortress in the future.

Well, I've been trying out various protein powders this year, for trying to lose weight, not for working out.As I type this, I have six different brands in house in various flavors.  Syntha-6 beats them all on the flavor.I try the mixes with milk, but judge them on how I normally drink them, which is with cold water.(Milk and I don't agree very much, so I have to limit my milk intake drastically.)So far, I've only tried the Syntha-6 in the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor. I read through almost all the reviews before purchasing,and looked up more on the actual contents of the product on another site. (This is a downfall of Amazon's - they don't provide enough information on the ingredients for food products! To list foods, I wish they'd require at minimum that the Nutrition Facts label contents be posted!Anyway, I must say that this powder has fantastic flavor, both with water and with milk. It is higher in calories than some of the other brands out there, but has more protein. One of the reasons I tried it (and the reason I rule out many other brands/flavors) is that this has NO ASPARTAME. I am allergic to it, and must watch all foods and supplements carefully for it being snuck in to the mixes. This does have some corn syrup in it, which is probably why it tastes so good! But, if you are someone who is avoiding corn sweeteners, then note that this item has it.It tastes a lot like a bowl of good vanilla ice cream that melted would taste. Yes, it is that creamy and tasty.My only real complaint about this item is that it makes a very thin-bodied shake. It is like a glass of vanilla milkin texture. If you mix it with water, it looks like really cheap skim milk. That's a bit of a put-off. I ended up mixing it half and half with a flavor of Spiru-Tein and got a decent, tasty thick shake. (Note that I really don't like Spiru-tein's vanillas - there's not much hope for them. But other flavors mix nicely with this brand's vanilla.)Now, note that I have limitations in my mixing that many others won't have. I am partially disabled, so can't always get ice when I want it, or just throw some frozen fruit into the mix. Many times, I am home alone and the kitchen is downstairs, out of my reach. I did try this with ice, and that helped A LOT. Definitely better and a tad thicker when ice cubes were added to the mix. But, I don't see why Syntha-6 doesn't add a little more of some type of thickener to the mix. It would make a world of difference in the general texture of the drink. I haven't tried adding a little guar gum myself yet, so don't know if that would help.Here is the ingredient list:A Sustained Release Ultra-Premium Protein Matrix Comprised of (Ultrafiltered Whey Protein Concentrate [Milk] Rich in Alpha-Lactalbumin, Microfiltered Whey Protein Isolate [Milk] Rich in Whey Isolate Peptide Fractions, Calcium Caseinate, Micellar Alpha and Beta Caseins and Caseinates [Milk], Milk Protein Isolate [Milk], and Egg Albumen [Egg], Glutamine Peptides), Richmix Sunflower Powder Consisting of (Sunflower Oil, Corn Syrup Solids, Sodium Caseinate [Milk], Mono- and Di-Glycerides, and Dipotassium Phosphate), Litesse II Polydextrose, Natural and Artificial Flavors, Nutrisperse MCT Powder Consisting of (Medium Chain Triglycerides, Non-Fat Dry Milk, Disodium Phosphate, and Silicon Dioxide), Ticalose Cellulose Gum, Sucralose, Acesulfame Potassium, Lecithin [Soy], Aminogen, and Papain.Overall, I really like this product. Since I started using it, my nails have been growing like crazy!  Not sure if it is related to this product, but it was certainly a change I experienced. I don't feel hungry afterwards, and it doesn't leave me with ""hairy tongue"" like some powders do. I definitely will be trying some other flavors as the finances allow.

I have tried many a protein powders in my many many years working out, but this one is by far the best.  I recently got the chocolate mint flavor for myself and the vanilla ice cream flavor for my husband (since he doesn't like chocolate mint or mint anything), and have used it for about a week now.Until a week ago, I was using the Elite XT powder from Vitamin Shoppe, but I will never go back to it- Syntha-6 is really that awesome!  It's got a great taste- even the vanilla flavor, and I usually don't like ANY vanilla protein powders because they give me heartburn for some reason.  Not this one!  The quality of this stuff is amazing, and it's really filling.  I haven't tried it with water yet (I'm traumatized my using Muscle Milk with water... aka dissolved chalk in a cup, eew), so I use the unsweetened plain 40 calorie almond milk with it (Almond Breeze, I think).  The flavor is really smooth, and has that ever-so-slight dairy, milkshake kind of aftertaste without actually having to use ANY milk products (except the protein, of course).  I don't like milk at all, and was allergic when I was younger but I'm not anymore.  I've always drank Soy and used tofu, and then in recent years since it's become more widely produced, almond and coconut milks; I can't stand the taste of cow milk- yogurt, some ice cream, and cheese is as far as my dairy consumption goes.  Even still, if I have too much lactose my nose gets stuffy and all that fun stuff.  My husband has become more sensitive to lactose in the last 2 or so years, too, so this protein powder is really nice for that, even though it is whey; there's no bloating, no upset stomach, and is really tolerable if you're sensitive to lactose (I actually didn't even know it was until I read the whole label yesterday, it's that good).That being said, after using it for about a week, I love it!  It really does keep you absolutely stuffed until your next meal 3 hrs later.  My husband agrees; with the Elite XT he would have to add extra fruit or almond/peanut butter to his protein shakes to stay fuller longer, but hasn't added anything to any of his shakes made with the Syntha-6 powder, which is amazing.  It has an awesome flavor with no nasty chalk or salty aftertaste, and is really nice after a hard workout- it really does reduce your soreness and decreases recovery time.  I can't say too much about fat loss benefits yet, but I imagine with how filling it is, and how well the body responds to it after a workout it would be pretty effective in helping.  Only time will tell, but so far, so good!  I don't think I'll ever buy another brand of protein powder, I'm an addict already.(The only reason I give it 4 stars is just because I haven't had it long enough to evaluate its benefit toward fat loss, but I'm sure it will be changing to 5 stars...)

I've been loving the syntha-6 proteins, haven't found a bad flavor yet. I decided to try peanut butter cups.When opened, the smell knocked me back a bit. It's awful. Even checked the expiration date thinking it was bad, but nope, all good there. I've been drinking protein powders for years and never experienced this.The taste is fine though. Does taste like peanut butter cups. It's weird. I like the taste but the smell almost ruins it. I'm also not a huge fan of the crunchy balls in it. Mint chocolate has them too but I enjoyed the texture element in the mint flavor. For some reason I just don't like it in this one.All in all I can't really give this a bad review. It does taste pretty good. Maybe subjectively it's just not my thing.

I’ve been very picky about anything protein related. I’ve tried so many different brands with very little success because the taste of the protein is always too strong and leaves a bad after taste in my mouth. I’ve luckily found a protein bar I really like and now I can add this protein powder to that list. This protein powder was delicious. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. I was kind of dreading it ever since I purchased it because I was afraid I wasn’t going to like it and waste my money. But it was sooooo good. The vanilla flavor was strong and the protein taste was barely there. I use oat milk which gives it a thicker texture which I like because it was like drinking melted ice cream. I will definitely be purchasing this again as I work on my muscle building.

I have tried some protein shakes (I won’t say that a lot of them, but still some), and I think this might be the best I have tried.I LOVE it’s flavor, many other protein shakes taste weird or have a very disgusting blending texture, but this one dissolves into the milk quickly and smoothly, and the taste is amazing, it’s like drinking a Vanilla Ice Cream milkshake, I just love it.As for the quality, it seems to be a very good quality product, it does have some calories but they’re not much, is almost like taking a granola bar, and I mean, you really NEED some calories, and even more if you are going to the gym, and most of them are quite useful rather than “harmful” calories because most of them come from the protein itself, it has a little bit of carbohydrates but not much. I wish it had lower levels of cholesterol (they’re not very high but still would want it to be a little lower), but I also know that some cholesterol is actually necessary for your body, as all of the membranes of the cells have cholesterol in them. The protein itself seems to be from very high quality amino-acids, which are very important for real muscle growth.It’s very good because it also makes decrease my food craving and my appetite (which may be because of the high protein levels itself). And it does not give me any side or negative effects.The product content is quite good, and it will last very long, so for the price I think it’s very good.So far, so good, it really has helped me to gain some muscle at the gym, without gaining fat related weight, it has done it’s job, I love it.

I've been taking some form of protein powder for over a 20 year period.  Recently, I've looked for an all in one powder that I can readily make and shake after workouts as well as before bed or during the day if I need a quick meal replacement. This would replace whey after a workout, and casein before bed I am just tired of buying multiple bottles of protein powder. I also just started using a new pre workout instead of C4 
it's called METAHUMAN by Prime SUPPS
.  I found it cheap and works well. This stuff with protein on an otherwise empty stomach in the AM before cardio is really shredding the fat away and gives me great energy throughout the day!Anyway this protein product fit the bill nicely. I look for 4 things when picking out a protein powder (not in any particular order) :1) Nutrient profile: This has 22 grams of protein, and includes a mix of whey and casein, which is what I was taking before in two separate products. It also has 15 grams of carbs, which is pretty low (I'll buy anything below 20g of carbs, but the lower the better).2) Flavor: Taste is pretty good. I usually get protein in either chocolate or vanilla, and I got the Vanilla Syntha-6. It doesn't have any sweetener aftertaste or gritty flavor, which is a problem. I usually mix it with water, it tastes as good in water as it can taste. I'll occasionally mix it with milk, which makes it almost creamy tasting but beware Dairy can make you hold water so I only do that when I am bulking or not worried about overall calorie intake.3) Mixability: Syntha-6 mixes extremely well in water or milk in my shaker bottle, with no clumps. A little bit sticks to the side, which I will chalk up to normal it’s sort of unavoidable.4) Price: Price was descent and better than I can find in a GNC or similar store.  Under $25 for over 28 servings of quality protein is a good deal. It's not the cheapest protein powder, but you get what you pay for.IDK everyone has their own favorite protein but this one seems to cover a lot of bases especially if your not prepping for a show.  Good luck in finding what works for you!

Since I've joined a gym and begun to focus on what goes in my body, I'm working towards a moderate-protein, 1200ish calorie-a-day diet.  I used to be an athlete in college, and I know how gross some protein shakes can be; many are just downright unpalatable.  I did some research about protein powders with a decent amount of protein that both mix well and taste great, and I ordered Syntha-6 Chocolate Milkshake.  For nearly a month, I consumed this flavor 1-3 days depending on my nutritional needs, workouts, etc.  In order to attain some variety, I also ordered Orange Smoothie, Mochaccino, and Chocolate Mint.  I also have subscribed to the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor, but it has yet to come.  I mix all flavors with water and ice.Chocolate Milkshake: Taste - 8/10.  Very creamy, tastes a lot like a variation of chocolate milk just with water.  This flavor is also excellent blended with a teaspoon of peanut butter or 2/3 cup of frozen strawberries.Orange Smoothie : Taste - 5/10.  It's ok.  It's going to be my bottom-of-the-barrell, use-it-only-when-it's-my-only-option flavor.  It tastes too off, almost like orange fluoride from the dentist.  Still very creamy.  I blended it with ice and blue berries and it was WAY better-tasting than just with the powder alone.Mochaccino: Taste- 7/10.  It's good and gets me through coffee cravings.  Sometimes I'll just say ""screw it"" and make a blended drink much like large coffee chains do, but I'll use the power, ice, and and a to-go packet of instant coffee in the blender.  It does kind of have a funky aftertaste.Chocolate Mint: Taste - 10/10.  My favorite flavor so far by a long shot.  Since I don't eat sweets, the Chocolate Mint flavor satisfies my cravings for Girl Scout Thin Mints, Andes Mints, and mint chocolate chip ice cream all in one.  I cannot emphasize how great it tastes.  The minty flavor stays with me like mint normally does, like fresh feeling in the mouth and back of throat.

I love this stuff. If I could give it 6 stars I would. It has the best flavor and texture in my opinion. I haven't tried the other flavors because the Vanilla Ice Cream has never gotten old so there has been no need to explore other options. I am not going to get into the ""ingredient breakdown"" wars that a lot of people like to do in reviews since I am no expert on these things. It does have a little more calories (not a concern for a lot of people, myself included), sodium and sugar than other products but not much. With that being said, as far as performance and recovery goes, I swear by this stuff. It has everything I need to feel great after the hardest workout. On heavy days I take 1.5 - 2 scoops if I need it. Syntha-6 seems to recharge me and give me the fuel I need to run the rest of the day. This may not be THE best protein on the market for building a lot of muscle, but if you want to get leaner, keep the muscle you have and still make noticeable gains, go with BSN Syntha-6. With a lot of hard work and many hours in the gym, I have lost about 15 lbs in 2 months and made noticeable gains in muscle mass. I honestly believe that this protein has helped with my progress so much. Maybe it just helps me recover quicker but I can tell the difference between the days I don't use this and when I do. I also like it because I am lactose sensitive and it does not hurt my stomach at all. I have tried the ON proteins and they seem to tie my stomach in knots, even though their products look a little better if you compare the labels. The taste and texture do not compare. I am by no means a fanboy of BSN because I really do not care for their pre-workouts and I typically go with ON Amino Energy or USP labs.

I chose this product based on several things.  The first factor was taste.  I had sampled a casein from Optimum Nutrition that was flavored as ""Blueberries and Cream"" that tasted, well, god awful.  I think that was likely a reflection on the particular flavor and not ON in general, I have taken their Amino Energy which tastes great but is pretty dubious as to its effectiveness.  In light of those experiences, I had heard nothing but good things about the taste of Syntha-6 and I can confirm that this stuff does indeed taste damn good.  Given the amount of carbs, fat, and ""corn syrup solids"" in it, I suspected it probably would taste good.  Cold Swiss Miss hot chocolate is a good reference for how you can expect this to taste.  I've also tried the vanilla flavor and while I prefer the cake batter, vanilla was fairly tasty, didn't have as much of a chemical taste as some vanillas do.  Additionally, I have no issues with dairy/lactose/gluten all that stuff so I can't give any reflection on what effects it has on someone with a sensitivity to any of that.The second factor was price; I have never had too much of a budget for these sorts of things.  It's cheaper than a lot of proteins that I have seen.  Most any protein powder with a reasonable price and good taste is going to contain artificial sweeteners and those things, and this is no exception.Overall, the comparatively high levels of fat and carbs in this mean it is probably best for those looking to gain weight as they train and also for people looking to use these things as meal replacements.  Price is decent, making this a good value in my estimation.  There are better options out there, but there are also a ton of lesser options as well.

I'm not a body builder or a hard core gym freak, but I do what I need to do to stay healthy. I take a pre-workout and protien shake twice a day, once in the morning and once immediatly after my workout and that's all the workout supplements I take.I've used ON Gold Standard, Dymatize Elite, and Scivation Whey. I think they are all great and have a good taste and are also easy to mix, but I'm leaning more towards the Syntha-6. First let me say that the cake batter is the best tasting protien I've ever had, even my wife liked it (and she's very picky). Secondly, the mixability is good but I use the blender ball and that always gets it done. I did try to mix it one day without the blender ball and had some clumps, but nothing too bad. I felt like I had a noticable difference in the performance as well.I started taking syntha 6 after I took about 7-8 months off from the gym and I wasn't taking anything that entire time. I was literally starting out fresh. I've done this before and I knew the first 2-3 weeks would be the worst. Muscles swelling, cramps, aching and so forth, HOWEVER I had none of that. This was the first time I didn't have cramps or severe swelling. I didn't hold back either, I pushed and did the force rep method and even some drop sets. The Syntha-6 gave me quick recovery times and excellent support for muscle growth. It was immediate. I had people asking me if I had been working out by week 2. They could see it that fast. 2 scoops in the morning every day (on days and off days) and then 2 scoops immediatly after your work out will get it done.This is an excellent protien for the money and worth the try. I'm going to stick with this product for the long haul.

This product review pertains to the purchase of a 5.04 lb container of Vanilla Ice Cream flavored BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder. Previously, some protein powders would leave me with the full stomach and bloated feeling after a workout. On the advice from a roommate, I was directed towards this product that has easy digestion and has a satisfying post-workout absorption.There are 25 grams of protein in each scoop and this is more than adequate for results. Only having to take one scoop is great for digestion and also limits the feeling of post workout bloating. The flavor “Vanilla Ice Cream” has tremendous taste and does not leave a chalky or powdery protein flavor like many other protein powders. Apposed to mixing with milk, I mix this product with water and throw in a few ice cubes to make sure the shake is chilled. This makes the already great flavor even more desiring.I have used this product for four weeks now and there are obvious gains that I have not seen in previous protein powders. I previously used Muscle Milk and was putting on undesirable fat weight in my abdominal area. This product has helped me to lose 25 pounds of fat and build lean muscle mass. What gives this product an advantage is the addition of the amino acids along with the whey protein. These two components work in tandem to give a serious athlete or weight lifter the most beneficial results for post-workout.This product is a wonderful source of protein, amino acids and flavor. BSN is a well-known supplement company that always puts out great products. Synthna-6 is not the cheapest protein on the market, but you get what you pay for.  In this case, the slightly higher price gives the consumer desirable quality and performance. I would recommend this product to any serious athlete or weight lifter.

I use a fast-absorbing whey protein powder before and after a workout but was looking for a longer-acting protein source that I could supplement during other parts of the day to get the total amount of daily protein I was looking for.  Syntha-6 contains whey protein but also has slower absorbing milk and egg proteins that my body can use on a more sustained basis when I'm not working out.  I take the Syntha-6 before I go to bed so my body has a lasting source of protein for recovery while I sleep and again in the morning to replenish my protein levels until I get to work out later in the day.  So Syntha-6 is great for fueling my body with protein when I'm not working out, and the vanilla ice cream flavor tastes fantastic.  It tastes great even with just water, but sometimes in the morning I'll mix it with 8 ounces of 2% milk and pour it over cereal for a great tasting source of protein and carbohydrates to get the day started -- and it's absolutely delicious!If I had to point to any negatives it would be that the cholesterol level is higher than I'd like probably due to the egg protein, but I'm okay with it because a Syntha-6 drink often substitutes for another less healthy snack I may have eaten instead.  So for my purposes Syntha-6 has been a great supplement and a relatively good value on a per-serving basis.

I have tried several protein powders over the course of 5 years..... THANK GOD I found this one. It is by far the best tasting WHEY protein powder I have found. I found it at GNC for the same price as here on Amazon but it was for a lot less quantity.... I will be ordering it on here from now on. I am not a chocolate person and tried several chocolate shakes through the course of finding a delious Whey protein. I had stuck with one for awhile but was never thrilled with it. This Vanilla protein powder I found that I can add several things. Fruit or PB Powder (peanut butter powder) all mix well but the best so far is unsweetned cocoa powder.I use 8 oz of FAIRLIFE fat free (more protein) milk, one scoop (or 4 tablespoons) Syntha-6 powder. I had ice and shake with make shaker cup (you could use a blender then add the ice) then I use a little hot water to mix in 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder (I use Hershey's) and add 3 packets of Sweet & Low. Then after it dissolves I add it to my protein mixture and shake some more and add more ice since it melts it. I is the best chocolate protein shake ever and it actually tastes better than a REAL CHOCOLATE shake from Dairy Queen.All the other whey shakes have a funny after taste to me or they tasted sour this one does not have that problem. If you add the protein powder to milk with nothing else it tastes just like a vanilla shake. And Whey is the best absorbed into your system. I was trying all kinds and before this one I landed on a Soy Protein which was not horrible but this one kicks it's butt.

Best tasting hands down. I've tried so many protein powders as a part of my very active lifestyle - including Dymatize, Optimum, Body Fortress, you name it. I won't go out on a limb and say that this protein has the best ingredient profile, because I'm not so sure. It is 400 calories for 2 scoops - in comparison, other isolate powders (this is not an isolate, just to be clear) have in the range of 110-130 calories per scoop for a total of 220-260 for 2 scoops for the same amount of protein. To be fair, not everyone that supplements with protein has the goal of losing weight like I do. When you supplement with a goal of cutting calories/weight, you would probably not opt for something as calorie dense as this stuff - but let me just say that this stuff tastes AMAZING. As a side effect of it being so delicious, I am far more likely to remember to take it than forcing down some stuff that tastes like cardboard - again, to be clear, I'm not saying that the previously mentioned brands tastes like cardboard - they taste great while providing a lower calorie solution to those with specific goals. This in comparison probably has a lot more fillers and questionable additives to achieve a superior taste profile, and most folks have no clue what they are consuming - but it comes at the cost of additional carbs and calories which may not work for everyone. In my case, I use this as a meal replacement for breakfast because I'm busy and I hate eating eggs and yogurt all the time. This is a lazy man's solution for reaching your fitness goals that tastes like God himself put it together. Strawberry is the bomb.

SYNTHA-6 is an ultra-premium lean muscle protein powder, and the best-tasting protein supplement on the market. Its formula features multiple quality proteins resulting in a nutritious and multi-functional protein supplement that ensures an athlete's muscles a quality supply of protein building blocks. As any athlete knows, high-quality protein is essential for building and maintaining lean muscle mass. SYNTHA-6 is the ideal solution to any active individual's protein needs, designed to perfectly suit a variety of diets and lifestyles. And with SYNTHA-6, that high standard of quality comes with taste to match, thanks to BSN's exclusive flavor technology.BSN is a solid and trusted brand with many great products, and Syntha-6 is no different. At a cost-per-serving of about $1 compared to other popular proteins at around $1.30, it is definitely a great price for a great product.The flavor I have been drinking is Vanilla Ice Cream and let me tell you... it is amazing. It mixes well, isn't thick, isn't gritty, and taste great. I would call it the best Vanilla protein I have tried so far. I workout pretty damn hard(and often) and when supplementing with Syntha-6, instead of being sore the next morning I am just a little tender and full mobility.Ok, so I broke down everything good about the product, how about some bad.The calories, fat, carbohydrates, and sugars are higher in Syntha-6 than other popular proteins. If you are looking for a protein with low levels of those things, well, this might not be for you.I love this stuff and I am glad I don't watch my calories,far, carbs, and sugar because drinking protein after a workout is tough, but Syntha-6 taste so good that I have no trouble downing it after a tough workout.

Coming from the cookies and creme version of this product (same size), the chocolate peanut butter has a great flavor and doesn't taste overly sugary. I mix this with a milk alternative called Silk (using milk adds lactic acid to your muscles, which causes that burning feeling after many reps) and when shaken for about a minute using 2 scoops, the product has no clumps. It's comparable to other mid level products and it's not exactly a meal replacement however, for best results always use protein supplements within 30 minutes of rigorous exercises for bigger gains. For people using this as a meal replacement, rethink your stance as diet is easily the sole factor for gains no matter how hard you work out, your body needs fuel. That being said, combine this with a sport multi vitamin and L-arginine and you've got a great combination for muscle recovery and energy support.

I drink a lot of protein, and as a result, have tried a lot of protein brands in the past, and this is by far my favorite brand of protein.I personally have never noticed better gains or anything like that when switching from brand to brand.  They all serve their purpose.  The primary differences, in my opinion, between brands are in their nutritional facts (caloric content, cholesterol, sugars, etc) and taste.  Syntha-6 is fairly run of the mill when it comes to protein nutrition in that it has an average amount of calories, some cholesterol, etc, so if you're looking for a protein that is really low calories, this may not be for you.  However, if you are looking for a protein that actually tastes good and doesn't make you sick to your stomach after drinking it, this is the best.  I always drink protein with water, and this stuff tastes good even in water.  A lot of people in the lifting community look down those who judge protein based on its taste, but if I'm drinking something in the morning, before a workout, and after a workout, it needs to be somewhat bearable.  This stuff definitely fits the bill for me.I've tried both the Vanilla and Chocolate Peanut Butter.  Vanilla tasted good, but was a little too sweet for me (it basically tastes like vanilla cake).  Chocolate Peanut Butter is the best tasting protein I've ever had.  Its taste reminds me of Reece's Puffs cereal, and again, this is when mixed with water.This stuff is awesome, and it makes me realize how spoiled I am when I have to drink ON casein protein at night (which tastes awful).

Product is excellent. No complaints there. Some people complain about the carbs and fat. But, it is marketed and says on the jar itself as a meal replacement. When you compare this with the packaged MRP's, this is an excellent value especially with the Amazon discount. That being said, I am a bit disappointed with the Subscribe and save program on this product. It has been going up about a dollar or two each month. At first, I was paying $17 a jar. Now, it has that my next shipment will cost $22. If it goes up anymore, I may have to move on. There are a few other quality proteins on here that are cheaper and the prices do not seem to have gone up at all.Admittedly, there still doesn't seem to be anything better than this as far as taste and ingredients. This has 5 grams of fiber per serving. And the fat is mostly from essential fatty acids. Anyone that knows nutrition knows that these things are helpful in lowering your bodyfat. In the six months or so that I have used this, I have lost at least 15 lbs and have gotten significantly stronger. I wasn't really overweight to start with. I'm 6 feet tall. I'm now hovering around 180. Yes, the overall diet makes a difference. I'm not attributing everything to this. But, I've been taking 1-2 servings daily and I'm sure it has only been an aid to gaining muscle and losing bodyfat. It is also very versatile. Yes, you can use this after a workout. It does have whey in it. But works great as a meal replacement and the casein makes it great to have before bed.FYI, tastes great in water... No need to add more calories there.

The taste is excellent! I got the vanilla ice cream flavor, but I think it's the same as the vanilla (on the BSN website, only vanilla is listed; I suspect they shortened the name of the vanilla ice cream flavor to vanilla; I also compared the list of ingredients, which is identical).Pros:Delicious flavor, even when mixed with water.It mixes quickly and completely in a shaker bottle.Contains a nice dose of fiber (5g per serving).Nice and creamy consistency, similar to thick milk (but much better tasting).Cons:It's a bit pricey. A very similar tasting product, with nearly the same ingredients, but at a cheaper price, is Dymatize Elite Fusion 7 (creamy vanilla flavor). Actually, DEF 7 has a few carbs less (protein, fat, fiber is the same). To me, the flavor is nearly the same, which is not surprising, as the main ingredients, including the artificial sweeteners, are very similar.Neither a pro nor a con (depending on your goals with this product):Less than half the calories are from protein, so it's actually more like a meal replacement (MRP) than a pure protein powder. One serving has 200 cals, but only 88 of those are from protein (22g protein x 4 = 88). Nothing wrong with that if you want a nutritionally balanced shake. However, if you rather desire a more concentrated dose of protein in your shake (with less fat, carbs, and fiber), you may want to try Syntha 6 Isolate, or Optimum Nutrition's 100% Whey Protein Gold Standard. Those who try to stay away from artificial sweeteners should consider Dymatize All Natural Elite Whey (vanilla flavor is great!), which is sweetened with stevia.

I only workout so I can come home and take this protein. Best tasting protein I have found. I mix with a few ounces of milk, almond milk or oat milk and a banana, frozen black cherries, or frozen cherries and it’s like drinking a milkshake. Not the healthiest protein on the market in terms of fat and sugar but by far the best tasting I’ve found.

I bought this protein powder as a breakfast alternative - an ingredient for healthy smoothie to start the day and provide a good base of nutrition.  It tastes good, mixes well and overall I'm satisfied.  The reason for the review is the wonderful unintended consequence of using this product which is a significant reduction in the severity of my essential tremor. My left hand shakes and it has done so for quite a few years.  The Doctor didn't have any solution for it, other than maybe beta blockers.  It was getting progressively worse and was more annoying than anything.  Can't use a screwdriver with my left hand because it's nigh impossible to get it on or keep it on the screw head.  Not life threatening, just annoying.One serving of Syntha-6 reduced the tremor noticeably.  And after a week or so of 1 serving in the morning, the tremor is still reduced.  It's as if Syntha-6 is feeding my body and muscles something that was lacking.  Without changing anything else in terms of exercise, caffeine intake, diet, the tremor reduced to the point that it feels as if I'd gone back in time 10 years or so.  My hand and arm feel stronger, typing is easier and more solid.  It's a nice feeling.I'm 53, healthy and relatively fit.  Based on this initial experience with the product, I feel that Syntha-6 will help me stay that way and help me maintain and build muscle when I exercise.  This is not a scientific experiment - it may be that other protein powders could do this - but I am pleased with the result and the feeling of strength in my hands and credit it to this product.

This taste so good, wow, just like vanilla ice cream.  Unfortunately, my hubby had a malignant cancer removed from his face and now in radiation.  The doctor said that especially, where the radiation hits, he will suffer in his mouth and throat and won't want to eat.  Therefore, we need to have him drink protein shakes.  My son recommended this, he is a workout, health freak so I listened and I am so glad I did.  I add almond milk, crushed ice, a little water, frozen strawberries or 2 oranges and blend.  You will have a true strawberry shake or orange dream smoothy.  Yummy.  I just purchased the ""edge"" for myself now.  He gets the full fat to keep his weight up and I get the lesser.

This is a pretty good protein for the price. For awhile I was using Rule 1 protein before switching over to this recommended to me by a friend. I seen pretty good results from it. But just be aware that the last bottle I received tasted off. Like it was contaminated or out of date. I mix my shakes with essentia water and never had a problem before. But this last jar I got tasted off. The last shake I had from it before I stopped using that jar literally tasted like sour milk and I almost vomited. It’s probably too late for a return now but if you decide to get this make sure you let them know right away if you have this problem. Aside from that the first jar I had was great and like I said I seen really good results from it so don’t let my one bad experience discourage you from giving this product a try.

I admit, I am the pickiest eater on the planet. There are very few things that I will try right offhand, and protein shakes rank right up with what I deem ""funny food"", which are foods that I already know I don't like, so I refuse to try other types of that item. That was, until I got approved for weight loss surgery. I had to find a meal replacement shake with protein and made from whey isolate. For this notoriously picky eater, the decision was brutal. I'd heard a lot of people say that this was the best though, so I hesitantly ordered a 5lb jar. I hate wasting money, so I knew even if I didn't like it, I'd choke it down as best as I could to get my money out of it.Turns out? No force feeding necessary. When made with almond milk and ice, the resulting blended mix is pretty much a milkshake. Something about the almond milk enhances the Choc-PB mix far more than the 2% milk did. It turned into something I didn't mind using, as the taste made t seem like a treat instead of the punishment I thought it'd be.I've finished the first jar and I'm looking at another surgery to finish the bypass, and I'm going to be ordering another to help me through this leg of the trip as well. I haven't tried any other flavors, but Choc-PB gets a win from me.

We've been using Syntha 6 for a few months along with doing P90X and it's definitely making a difference. It does have a higher fat and carb content than many protein powders, so make sure you can fit those in your macro allowance for the day. My husband struggles to get enough calories is its not an issue for him; I use Syntha 6 as a meal replacement and occasionally as a before bed drink when I've worked extra hard that day. As far as flavor, nothing beats this. I also use ON Gold Standard Whey for after workouts and have used several others and this is 10x better than any other brand for flavor hands down.We've tried: Vanilla Ice Cream (10/10, we always have a tub of this around), Chocolate Milk Shake (8/10, good for chocolate but neither of us are big chocolate lovers so we get sick of it), Peanut Butter Cookie (9/10, super yummy as long as you really like peanut butter), Cookies and Cream (7.5/10, good but we got sick of it quickly) & Mochaccino (6.5/10, I love coffee but a bit too chocolate flavored for me). I'm sure we'll eventually try them all.This is a bit pricey as far as cost for the percentage of protein which is why I give it 4 stars, but if taste in important to you, this is a great product and we can definitely tell it's doing the job.

I've been using Orgain Vanilla which isn't bad at all, but, this blows that out of the water on taste. I know I'll need to alternate between plant based and whey to keep my tummy happy, so, I guess it will be these two.I even mixed them together with half a banana and almond milk and was pleasantly surprised with the results. I'm curious to try chocolate and other flavors now. I don't think any other brand will taste better than this...This makes me geek extremely full all day. Like, I literally have to force myself to eat after it throughout the day. But, that makes it easier to eat healthy and healthy portions.

I'm a young petite woman that has been working on fitness and losing weight for several months now, so my review is based on what this product has done for me and how it has fit into my lifestyle.I've tried many protein powders from GNC, Vitamin Shoppe, Muscle Milk, etc. I used to be a big fan of the Pure Protein in Chocolate Frosty, but found that I was experiencing a lot of bloating a half hour to hour after using it. After reading a lot of reviews on here, I decided to make the switch to Syntha-6 Protein Powder. I'm very impressed! No bloating, and it keeps me full for several hours after working out.I typically use Syntha-6 as a meal replacement (200 calories per scoop, so that's enough for me!). I was torn between purchasing this powder and the Syntha-6 Lean Dessert Powder (seems more targeted for women), but decided on this one. Google the differences in the product and decide what's best for you. There are a lot of fitness forums that will weigh the pro's and con's of using each product.I love mixing the vanilla ice cream flavor with water and raspberries. The raspberries break apart and it's like drinking a raspberry milkshake. This is hands down the best tasting powder I've used. There is no bad aftertaste, and it doesn't have the artificial taste that a lot of powders (particularly Muscle Milk) have. I plan on trying a lot of different flavors after my vanilla ice cream is gone. Mmm! Great product!

Syntha-6 has definitely helped me to recover and build muscle. Been using it for 5 months now, taking a scoop in the morning after I wake up and a scoop post-gym. Very good for people that are trying to bulk and add a little weight since the calories and carbs are higher than some more pure whey proteins. I've gained about 5 pounds of muscle since I started using it and working out. It also contains casein protein so it could be used as a shake before sleeping, however I prefer whole foods before bed.My personal ratings:Effectiveness: 9/10Taste:10/10Mixability: 9/10Digestion: 7/10Price: 8/10Great product, especially for the price. You can pay much more for whey that contains less fillers and no fake sugar (sucralose), but unless you are a serious bodybuilder, I don't see the point in spending more money. My only complaint is that the cookies and cream flavor made me a little gassy, but I haven't noticed this issue with chocolate peanut butter for some reason. I don't know why this would happen with a certain flavor, or if the flavor is even the cause of this. The only thing I could think is maybe the batch of cookies and cream I got wasn't good? Or maybe my body is developing a reaction? Not sure, but not a big enough problem to get me off the product. Will stick to chocolate peanut butter and enjoy the results.

After weight loss surgery (with complications), anytime I use protein drinks, it makes me sick - reminding me of the time I spent in the hospital.  I'm happy to report that while I can still taste the protein, it tastes better than ANY other protein powder I've had.  It still doesn't compare to pre-mixed protein drinks, like Premier Protein, but with milk it's good.  I have only tried Vanilla Ice Cream, but will be buying other flavors.  I do use this for meal replacement and I'm on a heavy protein diet (180g a day) for healing, so it can be difficult to hit that allotment and not blow my calories per day.The carbs are a bit higher than other powders, so folks that are limiting their carb and sugar intake should take note.  It also is 22g a serving, which is lower than some of the ones I've used.  But I'd much prefer to use this to minimize (not eliminate) my retching from the protein taste.One irritation is that the scoop was at the very bottom of the canister, so I had to dig it out.  Settling may occur I suppose.  I do recommend this powder, with the caveat on the higher carbs.

Very few brands offer protein powders that are not chalky in flavor as well as having high quality ingredients. BSN syntha-6 is definitely one my top 3 options because of that. As someone who struggles with protein intake, this is a lifesaver. I always get vanilla, so that I can add fresh strawberries, bananas, and/or blueberries, or peanut butter, and it’s super yum.

This is the first protein powder I've purchased on Amazon. I have purchased protein powders in the past from another site and they were pretty good, but I figured a change of pace is always a good thing so I went for the Syntha-6 five-pound container of Vanilla Ice Cream flavored protein powder.I've been using it regularly for a month and I am extremely happy with my purchase. I have noticed an increase in energy when I use it to mix up a recovery drink for during and after my cardio workouts. I do P90X workouts and this stuff is perfect for mixing up with a smoothie after I do one of the weight routines.This stuff is so delicious it's hard to believe it's healthy. I look forward to my workouts partly due to the fact that I get to consume this stuff. I have mixed it with water in a plastic water bottle and have had no trouble with clumping (separation of the powder and the water). I have also used the powder in fruit smoothies and it makes them even more smooth and delicious. It also has a really great aroma and tastes and smells very much like vanilla ice cream.The five-pound container is HUGE. I use roughly a scoop a day and I'm sure it will last me for several months. The only downside I can see for buying such a big container of the stuff is that I might get tired of the flavor after a couple months, but I don't foresee that being a problem with this stuff because it is THAT tasty.

It tastes delicious, however it doesn’t blend very well, it always balls up and creates little grainy chunks, which honestly I enjoy, more texture. It’s not so great for you relatively, higher fat, cholesterol, and sugar compared to other proteins but this is decent compared to others in Themis price range. You pay for what you get!

I had this on a monthly delivery for the last 4 years.  During that time 2 of the containers were difficult to dissolve in water, but I pushed through.  In December 2022 and February 2023 they were VERY bad (thats 10 pounds out of 15) and I had to choke them down.  Quality is a becoming a problem.  That and the jump in price from $40 to $62 with poorer quality forces me to cancel this monthly subscription.  Since Amazon won't accept this for return or refund (after 4 years) I'll shop at a local vitamin store, sampling a couple and decide on a replacement.

This is one of the first protein powders I've ever gotten years ago and I keep trying new ones but always ending up going to back to this. The taste is just too good and it fits with many different flavors and shakes. It's not gritty like most other powders and did I say that it tastes good? Because it does. It feels and tastes clean and not super processed, so I would say the ingredients are high quality.

My wife and I like to have a protein shake every day for lunch, and this is the protein that goes in it. We are not meticulously helthy people who claim to know the science behind every method of weightloss or diet, so I can't comment on things that are truly in-depth, but the flavor is excellent and the protein is filling.We use it for shakes, as well as in cooking/baking, and perhaps it's best claim to fame is the fact that when we give some to our friends, they can't tell anything is ""different"" about it. I'm the kind of person who is sensitive to the ""sugar free"" taste of soda or other alternatives, and I can't tell a difference.All in all, we would buy this again if the price stays consistant.

My go-to post-workout protein powder.  The taste in vanilla is excellent.  Typically, I make a smoothie with frozen berries, a banana, creatine, and leucine, and this product, and the taste of this powder blends in seamlessly.  Occasionally I'll just mix it straight-up with milk in a shaker.  While you might get some clumps going this route, they aren't unpleasant, like in some products.The powder is sweet, and doesn't have the chalky aftertaste of other powders.  Only one scoop is required for 25 g of protein, so the texture won't weigh down whatever concoction you put together, like some other powders I've tried in the past.I used GNC's Gold Standard for a really long time.  This has a richer taste, and provides a more calorie dense option.  That clearly isn't for everybody.  If you want to put on muscle while packing on as little fat as possible, Gold Standard might be the way to go for you.  Both products are similarly priced and similar in quality (though I find Syntha-6 slightly better tasting).  If, however, you want to bulk up and could afford to put on a few extra pounds in the process, go with Syntha-6.-Joe

I have tried some nasty tasting protein powders in my day and this is by far the best tasting. When mixed with a little water it tastes just like a vanilla milkshake. I know this has more calories and slightly less protein than other brands but this isn't 100% whey so it will have more calories. If calories is your concern than just make sure you account for it in your daily amount. You will still get more grams of protein per calorie than any other food source (for example I ate a salad with chicken, avocado, pumpkin seeds, and bell peppers for lunch and got 45 grams of protein but still cost me 455 calories). for 400 calories you can get 44g of protien. plus two scoops of this is cheaper than my salad! Anyway, my point is this stuff tastes amazing and does just the job I need it to. I rather spend a bit more money on something that tastes good, since I am not the type of person who will shove stuff down my throat just because it's fuel. I may be able to do so once or twice but I wouldn't wast my money on poor tasting protein powders with this on the market. I can't wait until I finish my workouts to drink this stuff!

Mixes well, tastes great, doesn't make me feel bloated or fill me up. However, this protein isn't the best in a lot of categories. It's price per serving isn't the best, it's protein per scoop isn't the highest, nor is it's BCAA's per scoop (Or as BSN calls it, EAA's). With some light research, you can easily find cheaper or equally priced protein that beats Syntha-6 in nearly every category, but that in no way makes this a bad purchase or waste of time. It isn't a protein isolate, but it's probably one of the best regular whey proteins out there. I'd recommend this to some just getting into working out or someone getting their feet wet while searching for a beginner protein, but for someone experienced or looking for a change of brands, this might not be for you. It's not going to make you gain massive amounts of muscle/weight or help you smash your bench press through the roof.-ProsTastes GreatNo bloating or fullnessMixes fairly well-ConsTends to get small clumps that basically refuse to separate in a Blender BottleIsn't the king of protein, price, or serving per scoop

Honestly this is one of the few Whey proteins powders that don't make me break out. I drink two shakes a day on top of a healthy and lean food plan. The packaging could use some improvement as Amazon drivers don't care if the product gets damaged in transportation. That said I took off one star, but I love the strawberry flavor, and it mixes not too bad. Overall this is perfect for me. Inexpensive compared to other brands and doesn't cause any unnecessary ache.

This is my third flavor attempted (previously tried Double Rich Chocolate and Chocolate Extreme) and am a bit disappointed by the lack of flavor in it. I can barely taste the flavoring. If this makes the product healthier by limiting added sugars and artificial flavors, I don’t mind at all. I 100% prefer the healthier option. However, if you are looking for something more sweet and flavorful, this may not be the mix for you. I prefer the chocolate options over this one as of now.

Y'all, don't make the same mistake that I made. I decided to buy the strawberries & cream flavor wanting to try something new. I've tried a lot of whey protein powders before and honestly, even though some flavors are really good, most of whey protein powders end up tasting the same, like whey, and despite of the fact that I have a sweet tooth, the whey protein taste can really be tiring sometimes. I had never tried a strawberry flavor so I decided to give it a try, a mistake. At first it was not bad, I couldn't even feel the whey,  honestly, I even mixed it with water and still it wasn't awful. However, a week later I was already sick of the flavor, even though I even tried to mix it with milk but it didn't really work so I had to start mixing it with peanut butter and adding extra calories while on a deficit just to be able to swallow it and not waste my money. Again the taste is not really bad, is just that you might get worn out of it sooner than you expect, if you want to try it I can give you basic advice, buy just a few pounds and try it, then you find out if you're really into this flavor, unlike me who decided to buy 5 pounds all at once :(. It always ends up a little chunky when I blend it, I don't know if thats good or bad, but it doesn't really score points to my already existing dilema with the flavor. Now, on my results, it does it's job. It really helped me putting on some muscle when I was still on a calorie deficit. I'll definitely try some other flavor in the future.

Since I started using Whey Protein, I felt in love with it. I've been using it for almost two years now, and I dont see me stopping soon. Really good flavour, you can taste and see the effects of the product. Give yourself time to read the labels of the package. There's a lot of very valuable information there. I say this because I personally know a ton of people who do not read labels of products, and end up misusing them. Totally reccomend the product.

I've recently been trying all the different flavors of protein powder offered by O.N. and came across strawberries and cream.  When I tried their original strawberry flavor, I loved it and so I was excited to try out this new strawberries and cream flavor.  Unfortunately it was not what I expected.  The flavor was very unpleasant and left an aftertaste that made me a little nauseous.  Even the strawberry part of the flavor tasted nothing like the original strawberry.  I honestly don't think I will be able to finish the container which is a little disappointing as I got the 5 pound container.  The powder did blend well, so it has that going for it but the flavor was just too overwhelming.  The O.N. brand of protein is still easily my favorite as I've tried at least 6 other flavors that have been amazing, but this one is going down as my one unpleasant experience with them.  I'm a little sad that I didn't just stick with original strawberry flavor instead.

This product would be great if it had Stevia instead of Sucralose. I have and I'm sure others do too, have a hard time digesting sucralose so I can't drink this. Please please consider taking the sucralose out.

I really enjoyed the original strawberry flavor purchased earlier this year.  This Strawberry & Cream flavor is not pleasant. It has  a strong stale taste with a  weak strawberry flavor.  I certainly will not buy it again.

I've always purchased the chocolate malt or extra chocolate flavor of this. The strawberries and cream flavor is absolutely disgusting. Very artficial tasting and EXTREMELY sweet. I'm gonna have to muscle through this container, hopefully i can hide the flavor with other ingredients.

I’ve used Isopure’s protein infusions before and really liked them. It’s nice to have a protein powder with options that are free of artificial sweeteners. I typically just use powders on days I need to get that last but of protein in but I’ve already met my carb and fat goals for the day and this brand has been great for that.I was specifically looking for a protein powder I could either bake with or add to my coffee in the mornings, so I wanted something that was both unflavored and free of fake sweeteners. I haven’t tried cooking with it yet (I’m thinking I can add to some oatmeal or breakfast muffins), but I have been putting it in my coffee with success.I took one star away because it DOES NOT go into super hot liquids like coffee straight from the pot or Keurig. However, if I add it after adding a bit of milk to cool the coffee down, it has no problem dissolving and even gives the coffee a bit of froth, which I enjoy. I was hoping to use it more like a creamer so I could skip the milk, but that’s just not going to be the case.It also goes into cold liquids and smoothies very easily without leaving a gritty texture like you get with plant based proteins (usually the only ones that will use stevia to sweeten). If you have any suggestions of flavored whey protein powders that use stevia please let me know!

I mean it says add to favorite beverage cold or hot... Well.. When you mix it with hot liquid such as coffee the powder congeals into this solid rubbery texture.  And if you are drinking out of a travel cup, you might not notice until this gross textured chunk winds up in your mouth.  And if you are driving, it might be so terrible that you need to pull over to spit it out.  Googled it and apparently this is something that people just know, but I missed the memo.  So many people with advice on their favorite method of adding protein powder to hot liquids.I had mixed it in my milk then added it to my coffee the day prior but it made my milk very frothy so I tried it directly in the coffee the next day.  After that first horrible experience I now have perfected a system where I mix my milk the night before and leave it in the fridge to settle then in the morning add it to my coffee and boom perfect.Good luck.  Definitely recommend in cold creamy drinks or foods.

If you are like me and hate the taste of pretty much all things labeled “protein” (bars, powders, shakes, etc.), this may be for you!!! No added sugars. No carbs. 100 calories per scoop.I mix one scoop with 1 cup fairlife milk and 1 tablespoon of chocolate syrup (no judgment. I like my chocolate milk folks).It tastes like a thicker version of chocolate milk but very little flavor change.I did notice if I tried it with white milk, it does alter the taste of the milk a bit but not awful…just not for me.HELPFUL HINTS:It tastes disgusting with coffee IMO. (Unflavored doesn’t mean NO taste. It’s sorta an earthy taste, but unnoticed in the milk).Do NOT use a shaker to shake it. It makes the fairlife foamy.I normally microwave the milk for about 20-30 seconds to bring temp to room temp to mix. It does not mix great with hot or cold drinks. “Room temp” or slightly warm seems to mix the easiest. Then I let it sit for a few minutes bc some of the clumps will pop open to mix. I add the chocolate and then add the drink to freezer for 15 minutes to make it cold.Yes, this is a bit of work, but hey. Gotta do what you can to get that protein in. I’ll be a lifelong fan!!! It has gotten my protein levels where I need them to be!!Giving it 4 stars only bc I wish it was a little easier to mix. Not a game changer for me though!!!! I’ll take it!

This protein powder was my first one that isn't whey protein and my first one since becoming vegetarian. I prefer unflavored protein as it gives me more control over what goes into my body (natural flavors...spices... Etc). This protein powder was everything I was looking for and was good for what it was. Here's how I felt.Flavor: it's flavorless, so it's going to have that ""flavorless flavor"" (sounds stupid, but you know exactly what I'm talking about). It's bland, earthy, and griany in taste. If you're a texture person be weary as it has a finly ground sandy like texture when mixed properly. I mixed mine with three different milks, oat milk by oatly (made me feel like I was licking dirt and depression off the floor), 2% lactose free Kroger brand milk (made this powder taste overly sweet somehow, but not in a good way, like the aftertaste when you take Pepto bismol) and Fair Life 2% milk (the least flavor altering). My favorite ""base"", was hands down the Fair Life milk.Mixing: this powder barely mixed with the oat milk and I quickly changed to cow milk. The two cow milks I tried mixed about the same, but be warned, when you mix it, add the milk into a blender cup first with the spring already in place, then add the power and mix immediately. No, don't even stop to put the lid back on your protein powder container. Immediately put the blender cap on and start shaking or you will get clumpy chunkies that make you want to vomit popping up throughout consumption. I shake mine for about 5ish minutes and if I'm busy I hand it to my spouse to shake for me while I replace the protein powder cap.For some reason shaking this protein powder with milk, makes the milk frothy. Not a deal breaker, but something to note if you're a texture person like me. You will still feel a fine grainy texture when mixed fully. It gets on your lips and no matter how much you try to lick it off, it still feels like it it's there.Would I buy this again? Yes.Would I recommend to a friend? Yes.Will this be my first choice of protein powder? Not likely as I've found a brand that works better for me.Hope this helped!

I tried it because I’m on a strict weight loss plan with a keto diet and I’ve read bad things about sucralose and artificial sugars in other protein powdered. I was nervous about the unflavored taste because I don’t want to mix it with anything besides water. The first thing I noticed is when I mix it, it does get a lot more foamy and bubbly than other powders I’ve used. But that’s not a big deterrent. I was surprised that I really like the taste. It’s very mild and watery but still pleasant enough. I will be sticking with this instead of ON Gold Standard for whey protein.

I used it in a protein shake. I just mixed it with milk and frozen strawberries and blended it all together. There was a very slight dry milk flavor but overall it was soooo much better than other protein powders. Tasted like a strawberry milkshake. I have tried a few other protein powders.

I was tipped off to this by an influencer I enjoy watching on YouTube. As a woman approaching 50, I was seeking an easy & sustainable way to add some additional protein to my diet. I use this unflavored protein powder in my morning green smoothie - only 1T vs. a scoop, because my smoothie already contains quite a bit of protein, but this extra “boost” rounds it out nicely! It blends smoothly, zero taste! Truly unflavored! I’m so happy I found this & will continue to repurchase.

I'm lactose intolerant so finding a protein powder has been a challenge.  Tried this one and have not found a way to eat it without the taste overpowering what I mix it with.

Isopure Unflavored Whey Isolate Protein Powder is the first protein powder I have tried. I chose unflavored because I wanted to be able to mix it in a variety of foods and beverages. Also, because there are no additional calories as found in flavored protein powders.  While it is unflavored, it is not tasteless. Whey is a dairy product and I would say the taste is “milky”. It works best for me when mixed with oatmeal, coffee or my chocolate protein shake. To keep the taste from being overwhelming, I divide my daily scoop into two servings.  The powder didn’t seem to mix in very well, so before I add it I stir in very small amounts of liquid(depending on what I’m going to put it in) and make a smooth “paste”’. This allows me to get all the powder dissolved and smash out all the lumps. Then I continue to add small amounts of liquid till it is thin and runny.  This makes it blend in very well. Will continue to buy this product to increase my protein intake without excessive calories.

I had gastric bypass almost two years ago. Protein intake is a MUST for all Bariatric patients. I used other protein powders before but I wasnt happy with them. I’ve been using the Isopure Unflavored protein for over a year and I am very pleased with it! I use it two to three times per day in my coffee. It doesn’t mix well if you put it really hot beverages and it will be clumpy. So I usually put a bit of creamer in my coffee and let it cool off for about 5 minutes before adding a scoop of the Isopure powder in. I find it mixes better if you let hot beverages cool off a bit and adding the protein powder in slowly, a little at a time. If you mix it this way it will mix smoothly and well.  I actually like how it makes my coffee texture seem creamier! Also, more importantly, my lab work results are always good so I know this protein powder is doing its job. Also note…I usually pour my powder in an older container so it’s easier to store and stays fresher longer as you can see in the included pictures.  I buy Isopure every week and plan on doing so for the unseen future! I highly recommend.

Ditch your other proteins supplements  and get some isopure protein . This unflavored protein powder is my favorite . It mixes well in soups, beans, coffee, tea, shakes, gravies, just about everything that has liquid.  I have even used it to batter my air fry chicken nuggets .  There is zero flavor however it’s not completely tasteless. .

Love this protein powder!!I have a hard time finding protein powder that doesn't make me sick or give me a migraine. I have a sensitive stomach and artifical sweeteners give me migraines. I have had a shake with this almost every morning the last 2 years. 1 scoop of this. 1/2 a scoop of pb powder and about 6 onces of silk dark chocolate almond milk. Shakes up great in a small shaker bottle. Can freeze it a little while and it's like a dessert! Just remember to take the shaker ball out first.My picky kids even like it!! They drink my shake. Also I've made smoothies in the mixer- this with milk/ banana/ some chocolate syrup for the kids as well. Toss some other frozen fruit in from time to time. It blends out with no taste and no chunks. I've mixed it in with oatmeal (premix packets and quick oats) and its good. For overnight oats I prefer to add this in the morning and shake well before eating vs putting the powder in at night.I can't mix with water- it does have an off taste alone. It also has a bit of odor when you open it. I've baked with it a few times. It was alright but it's just not something I've perfected yet.Overall- I would be in trouble if they stopped making this! My stomach (ulcers among other issues) behaves so much better when this is my breakfast. I'm able to get protein without hurting my stomach in the morning. I can even have multiple shakes in a day with no issues.

I do but don’t like this protein powder. It thickens foods if you’re mixing to just try and get more protein in and it leaves a film in your mouth. It is unflavored but depending what I mix it with I can still taste it sometimes. I would purchase again, but it could be better.

What I love the most aside, there is genuinely no flavor when using the product realistically; the powder is not gritty. It mices well with any liquid as well as puréed foods. I was utterly surprised. Now I must admit that if you’re using it in puréed foods, you need to make sure that you’re considering how much of the powder you’re putting into that particular food.I have purchased countless protein powders, and one of my most significant issues is that it feels gritty when you drink or mix it with foods. I also want to reiterate that you really cannot taste it.This will be my go-to from here on out!

While the product does state that it is unflavored, there is a slightly noticeable milk like flavor, which should be expected as the protein is derived from milk. I have only used this mixed into fruit, smoothies, vegetable smoothies, and black coffee. When mixed into either type of smoothie I make the flavor is not noticeable. when I have mixed it into black coffee, again, the flavor is not necessarily present, but it’s almost like a very light plain creamer taste. For me, it’s not a problem and does not cause me to not enjoy anything that I have mixed it with so far.

i know, 'bowels' is just the word you wanna hear in a food review. but this is exactly why i wanted to try a whey isolate like isopure.i write this review out of sheer empathy for anyone else who experiences the below when trying to get extra protein in their diet through convenient protein powder, whether you're into bodybuilding or general fitness or whatever.Previously through the past 20 yrs i've tried many brands of whey protein, usually the budget friendlier stuff rather than true isolate which tends to be a little pricier. In the last couple years though I was having some gut issues with even popular brands like ON Whey, gas, diarrhea (again, gross right?). So i dont know if i just became allergic or sensitive to the stuff or if my body doesnt like all the extras (fillers etc).after some research of reviews of isolates i saw helpful reviews saying that going with a true Isolate could help so i gave it a try. i've tried isopure for a month or so at the time of this writing and have zero issues with it so am happy with it. it is a little more expensive than cheap whey protein, but to avoid the above mentioned issues, its worth it!!review of unflavored isopure zero carb:no extra flavoring is kinda nice as you can do what you want with it. just added it to some oatmeal and hey, it can taste like oatmeal vs chocolate oatmeal if i had added a choco flavored protein. (nothing wrong with that, just saying you have more flavor flexibility going with unflavored, but by all means do as you will)Mixes pretty well (most isolates should), is not 'grainy' like some cheaper wheys can be. in the oatmeal example, i have no clue that its in there other than i can tell a slight 'milkiness' quality both in texture and taste. the 'flavor' of unflavored isopure is best akin to a 'milk' aftertaste (doesnt sound appealing i know, but again, you're not buying this for the TASTE of it by itself but that you can add it with whatever flavorings you desire: juice, milk, chocolate, smoothies, cooking, etc)  - and when doing so its own slight flavor of milkiness is easily overpowered by whatever you would add.anyway, if you've had gas bloating or worse with other protein powders, particularly anything less quality than an Isolate, give something like Isopure 100% whey protein ISOLATE a shot. just buy a small bag so you can try it before buying bulk to save $.simultaneously i'm also trying dymatize protein isolate, so far only had a serving of it so can give a good review yet, but off the one serving didnt have any negative impact so i'm optimistic it will also be a good way to go.thanks

I bought this because I'm really not a huge fan of most protein sources and am always looking for creative ways to get my protein in. I wanted something I could just hide in my meals and not even really know it's there, but get an extra little boost of protein!Some things I typically add it to (I usually add it after my stuff is fully prepared or cooked... I haven't tried anything fancy like baking with it yet... I don't enjoy cooking much) are my cereal, my spaghetti after it's all prepared and cooked, my coffee (mix with a frother), my barbeque sauce when I'm dipping stuff in it, and I'm sure there are some other random things I have tried as well. I have used it in ramen noodles once successfully, and once unsuccessfully (it clumped up the second time. I think that was because my ramen noodles were hot, and I was storing my protein powder in the fridge at the time so it was cold.... I think that's what happened.) I rarely ever use a full scoop, I just add in little by little and taste as I go to make sure it's still yummy and the texture is still good - but for me, any protein I can sneak in is a win. I have also used it in smoothies because I'm not a huge fan of flavored protein powders in my smoothies - they typically take over with their taste, whereas this doesn't really taste like anything at all.The smell of the powder when I open it is NOT GREAT lol. I just try to hold my breath when opening the bag, then once it is in the food I cannot taste or smell it anymore. Win!

UPDATE- so I have went through an entire bag of this already. I do put it in most everything however, I wanted to update my previous comment. I have detected a slight smell & flavor to this flavorless protein. When I first noticed I wanted to throw the whole bag out & gag BUT I talked myself off the ledge & convinced myself that I eat & taste protein in ALLLLLL my protein products. Shakes, bars, snacks. It’s there & I handle it just fine. I have removed it from certain food items like my morning coffee. Apparently my taste buds are extra sensitive in the morning and where I wish I could get that nice dose of protein in right away I’ve opted to enjoy my coffee without a trace of smell or flavor. It goes in my shake immediately following coffee. I just ordered my 2nd bag. I’m 6 weeks post -op & feeling great and I contributed it to my diligent protein intake!!I recently had bariatric surgery and knew I was going to need a good flavorless protein to add to my food. I hate the taste of Whey protein. After reading many reviews I finally decided to just try this product.  I am floored.  Zero taste. Zero bad smell.  I am adding it to everything and accomplishing my Protein requirements daily. If you are adding this to something hot I recommend putting it in a bowl with a little hot water and making a watery paste and then adding it to your hot liquids.  If you’re putting it into hummus or something cold blends right in with no chunks.  Read some reviews were people are complaining about it not mixing in, well you just have to use common sense and prepare it the proper way depending on use.  This will be my forever protein!!! So glad I found it

I have gone through 2 lbs of this product, and have now received a 3 lb tub because I have decided this is the powder to go with.  It's great for an unflavored powder because it actually is flavorless!  I've had other unflavored powders, but those have been disgusting alone; terribly sour and acrid.  This stuff mixes up will with just a spoon and I can down it alone with water just fine.  There's a bit of that whey smell, but as long as you don't mind the thickness it's a tremendous protein supplement.  It's also cheap at $0.94/oz at the time of writing.  I've looked for cheaper stuff, but only crap with a bunch of sugar and creatine and whatever shows up, or the unflavored stuff is acrid, like I said.  In terms of flavor, value, and macronutrients, I don't think you can beat this stuff.That being said, I think Isopure is missing the opportunity to add their vitamin and mineral mix to this unflavored product.  If you look at their flavored stuff, they all contain a ton of additional micro-nutrients that I personally would find useful, but I do see some reasons not to include those.  Some people with kidney disease may not be able to handle taking in lots of minerals, like potassium I know is a big one.  And maintaining the pure ""unflavor"" may be difficult with the vitamin blend, though I don't know for sure.  Anyway, that is my only complaint.  If all you need is protein, look no further.One thing I really like to do is mix 2 scoops with 1 Tbsp of cocoa powder and optionally add 2 Tbsp of natural peanut butter.  It makes an awesome drink for a quick 50g of protein with no sugar added.

This is a good protein powder, but I do have a couple of issue with it.  The main one is that it does not load easily into the included scoop.  It also doesn't smell very good (admittedly I have had it for a while, but it is not expired).  It has a good amount of protein to add it to smoothies and other places where you need a protein boost.  It is also an excellent product for keto baking.

Slightly worried about the people in the reviews saying there’s no flavor. May need to get your tastebuds checked out 🥴. It taste like vanilla protein powder but not as strong. I have Creatine that is actually unflavored so I was expecting that. Super disappointed when I put a scoop in my strawberry lemonade and the taste over powered it.

after trying a few protein powders, my friend suggested I try this. It's FABULOUS. I love that it has only two ingredients, I can use a sweetener of my choice if I want to sweeten it. I typically make a cold coffee shake with it in my blender and I can barely taste the protein powder. I am a fan.

A lot of people are accustomed to protein powders being sweet, and consuming them as shakes or baked goods. After years of this I was sick of drinking my protein or eating baked protein powder foods that rarely actually taste good. I have been on the hunt for unflavored protein to use in savory/salty sauces and dips and this is a winner!I mix it with some Greek yogurt, a little water, and nacho cheese seasoning from FlavorGod and my goodness is it delicious and packed full of protein! I’ve also done the same mix but with curry powder and made a protein curry sauce to have over chicken. I’ve used it to make spicy mayo, garlic “Alfredo” sauce, and guacamole!The base taste of the protein powder is very subtle and honestly disappears into every mixture I’ve made with it.

Ok, I get that unflavored simply means no flavor added, so I'm not docking any stars. But make sure you understand that because my dumb behind thought it meant NO FLAVOR. It does not mean no flavor. THERE IS A FLAVOR. And what a flavor it is!!! This stuff taste like cow tittle sweat. It tastes like you had a nice tall glass of ice cold milk on a summer day that you couldn't quite finish, and forgot outside for a few days. During those days the water evaporated out and it left one of those little dried milk rings in the bottom of the glass. Then someone picked up the glass and went to wash it, but couldn't get the milk out, so they pulled a Jim and filled it with water to ""let it soak"". After 3 days the water has partially rehydrated the milk. That water is what this tastes like. Like toasted watered down milk from a cow with a yeast infection. Still a terrific product though. Will buy again, strongly recommend!

My wife was very critical of the artificial flavors of my favorite whey powders (ON varieties..  I admit that many of their flavors are artificial in a 'kids breakfast cereal' kind of way, except for Mocha Cappuccino which is awesome.)  She wanted to try blending unflavored whey into her favorite Chia Tea mix.  This sounded like a good idea; however, while mixing something 'unflavored' may not add new flavors, it does still affect the overall taste of the mixture.  She tried this twice, said 'Nope', and was done trying.I experienced the same thing when I first mixed creatine powder into my protein shakes; it delivers an element of absolute gritty 'blah' flavor across your tongue that you won't soon forget.  (Sand doesn't have a flavor either, but I don't want to eat it.)  So now I'm stuck with a nearly full bag of fairly expensive, high-end, unflavored whey.  I'll probably try to give it away to someone else.

This is the only protein powder I buy. It seems like the only protein flavors are chocolate and vanilla and you can’t just put those flavors with anything. I get the unflavored and put it in my pancakes, waffles, tea, and coffee. It does have a milk/dairy flavor to it. I put it in my black tea and it’s like milk tea. Put it in my coffee and it’s like coffee with milk. You do have to stir vigorously for it to blend well. If you put it in pancake/waffle batter, it does dry it out so make sure to ratio it right to where the final product is still fluffy. It’s a struggle getting 130g of protein in a day but the unflavored powder makes it more achievable.

I am new to the world of protein powders but have been trying to incorporate more protein into my diet. I prefer, at least for now, to add my protein to fruit smoothies, so I was looking for something that blended well but also could be added to my smoothies without affecting the flavor or having to build the smoothie around its flavor. This did just the trick! It doesn't taste like much of anything and even though it slightly changes the texture of my smoothies, I don't mind it.I haven't added it to anything else except oatmeal (didn't love that) but am looking forward to trying to bake with it or just do more basic protein shakes.

No taste as promised. Haven’t had any digestive issues yet thankfully.  I learned through trial and error that the powder curdles in really hot liquid (eg. freshly brewed coffee).

This stuff is awesome! I’ve been on a quest for a flavorless protein and after trying a few others I finally found the one. I love to mix it into smoothies, oatmeal, protein balls, peanut butter, yogurt, you name it. I read some reviews that said “this tastes awful” …but any powdered substance would taste awful if the ratio wasn’t right. Its not like collagen powder where it disappears into whatever you mix it in, but if you don’t want the added taste of the usual protein powders (chocolate, vanilla, etc) or the added sugars then this is your jam. I immediately noticed the texture is softer and more powdery than other proteins I’ve tried (almost like the texture of powdered sugar) and appreciate the short list of ingredients (why protein isolate). I would highly recommend this product if you want to taste your smoothie ingredients and only your smoothie ingredients.

*Update* After finishing my first tub and immediately reordering I have to admit I am obsessed with the flavor, I guess its an acquired taste and I fell in love with it. I am changing my original 4-star review to 5-stars. My new normal is to add a heaping quarter teaspoon of decaf instant coffee to the milk I mix the powder in with, an absolutely decadent tasting drink.________Original review below________Its mixes pretty well, it doesn't get lumpy, maybe a bit frothy, but that can be resolved quite quickly.The vanilla taste is definitely weird at first. At first taste it bordered on sickeningly sweet and slightly burnt, like twice roasted and them caramelized vanilla. After a week it started tasting more normal and after a month I am totally fine with the taste now.My favorite is to make make it with milk and then add a splash of black coffee, it actually tastes really good with some coffee added to knock back the sweetness and give it a bit more depth.

We drink protein powders every day both as meal replacements and also for after-workout recovery drinks. We find the Nitro Tech Whey Gold works well for us as a meal replacement or smoothie creator, because it has a medium level of thickness. We don't use this powder as an after-workout drink, because we prefer our after-workout drinks to be a bit thinner so they can swallow more quickly and easily.Also, while some powders easily shake into a smooth mixture, this one ends up with small lumps, even with fairly thorough shaking. It does do great with a blender though. So another point in the direction of kitchen-meals rather than on-the-go workout drinks.The Nitro Tech Whey Gold has both whey peptides and isolates. That's another reason we prefer this as a meal replacement or smoothie shake. We generally prefer just isolates for after a workout.The flavor, French Vanilla Creme, is fairly light in strength. It also has a bit of a ""chemically"" flavor. It is tolerable, but not as luscious as some other brands. Still, if we make a smoothie out of this and toss in a few fruits or berries, it forms a perfect base for the overall flavor profile.It's nice that the Nitro Tech Whey Gold has the ""authentication"" seal on the top of the lid so you know you're getting the real deal. On the down side, some of the other protein drinks we use guarantee that they won't pop positive (by mistake) on the various drug tests that are administered in the sports world. This shake doesn't have that statement. It could be they are quite fine and won't cause a problem, but it would be nice for them to guarantee it on the label.All in all, we like this, and use it fairly regularly as a meal replacement or smoothie option.

I always buy vanilla protein powder, because I can make whatever flavor I want out of it.  Chocolate.  cinnamon, strawberry, Peanut Butter, etc. Vanilla will turn into any flavor.  But this vanilla is not so great.  It has a weird chemical flavor that they added to make it taste like melted ""ice cream"".  I much prefer the regular vanilla from this brand, and honestly from other brands like ON.  Would not repurchase this, even though the price was good.

Keep in mind when you’re reading my review that I’m not very sensitive to the taste of protein powders. To me- it’s a protein powder so it should taste like protein.I also typically only buy vanilla powders bc they’re so versatile but I saw good things about the nitro tech chocolate and I wanted to try it.Guys this one is so so so good. It tastes almost like a chocolate shake (and I only use almond milk and the powder). If you want to fancy it up, I bet you could make it actually taste like a choc shake from Braums.It says to mix 1 scoop with 6oz of liquid so I always do 2 scoops and 12oz of almond milk. 50g of protein right there. I’m setting this up on auto delivery. Do yourself a favor and get this.

I love Muscletech usually but not this one. This is the first time I've tried the Whey Gold Nitro Tech and the flavor is terrible. Leaves a chemical aftertaste that is really hard to cover up. The Nitro Tech Whey Protein and 100% Grass-Fed are awesome in smoothies or even just cold water but not this one. The chemical taste even breaks through fruit smoothies. I'll have to find something that it will mix well with.

I’ve always liked the basic flavors of Nitro Tech (chocolate, vanilla, etc.), and this is right in line with all those that came before it. Still, I was shocked that the Vanilla Swirl tasted so good, yet has only 4g of carbs (2g sugars), AND adds and other ingredients (C. canephora robusta & L-carnitine) that aid in weight loss - all while delivering 30g of protein per scoop.With that in mind, I’ve made my first attempt to do some basic label analysis (see image). There are many important ingredients you could look at, but I tried to focus on some of the basics. I’m certainly no expert, and I’m sure there are some that may find this very basic, but I hope it helps others. I plan to continue to do this on future reviews, and maybe even evolve and expand the analysis.The bottom line: If you’re trying to watch your carb intake or cut fat while also ensuring you still hit your protein intake goals, I highly recommend this.

It has a unique flavor.  It helps me a lot with post workout.  My muscles do not suffer as much with its consumption.  Of course you always have to be exercising, don't take it but train.  Plus it lasts a long time.  I usually drink it with a bit of cocoa powder and sometimes I add a bit of skim milk.  But not always, you need to be careful with the kidneys.

This protein is advertised as “5.5lbs”, and this order for me was a reorder. My first order months ago, i did in fact get 5.5lbs. This order i received a 5.0lb tub. I understand the 5.5 was sort of a “bonus amount!”, but if muscle tech has switched back to the standard 5lbs, they need to change the listing. Protein is basically protein and i buy mostly based on price, which this price at 5.5lbs is great…for 5.0 it’s normal and i could explore different brands

If the flavor (chocolate) was a tad bit stronger, I'd give this powder 5 stars. Value for the money definitely 5/5 when compared to other brands.

This is my second protein product from MuscleTech.  The last product I tried was MuscleTech Nitro-Tech in Milk Chocolate.  Comparatively, this product contains less protein per serving (24 vs 30g) and does not contain any creatine.  The absence of creatine is helpful, especially if you already taking creatine separately.  It allows you to optimize the amount of creatine that you are consuming daily.In terms of taste, I find that it does a good job of imitating a cookies and crème flavour.  It does have a similar taste to drinking an Oreo McFlurry that has melted.  It does not have the strong whey taste that some protein powders usually carry. There are some artificial chemical aftertastes element as well.  Of course, you wouldn’t expect it to taste exactly the same as a real ice-cream desert.  I also find that the thickness when mixed with water is different than regular Nitrotech.  If you want a watery protein drink, then this would be suitable for you.  Strangely enough, despite this, I found the mixibility worse compared to the regular Nitro Tech.This drink provides the satiety after consumption, which is nice as a snack, or after a workout giving you a hunger-buffer before you can consume a meal with real food.It seems the volume per scoop is also consistently large with this brand.  In this regard, it will a) fill up youf protein shaker easier (a good or bad thing), and b) contain less servings per x/lb of a tub.  Take that into consideration when calculating what you need monthly.All in all, a solid tasting protein with a more flexible profile in terms of macros.

When MuscleTech recently updated the packaging and label they also changed the formula. Previously, this was the very best protein shake I have ever had -  tasted like a milkshake from McDonalds, and no lumps when mixed in a shaker. Now, the new version tastes about average for protein and it leaves lumps no matter how long or hard it’s shaken. Why did you ruin the perfect protein shake, MuscleTech? Please bring back the previous formula. The only positive thing is the value. The cost per serving beats the competition; hopefully, they don’t change that.

Tried this product because it was the closest nutritional value to what I normally get, and also about $25 cheaper. But now I wish I would've paid the extra money for better quality product. The flavor is nasty, something about it but it doesn't quite taste like other vanilla protein I've had. Also it messed my stomach up BAD,at first I wasn't sure what I could have eaten but after seeing that it only happened when I drank a protein shake with this powder I was able to see that's what was causing it. I typically split a big container like this with my roommate and it messed his stomach up too. Makes you super gassy and gives you a bubbly stomach. Tried to return it after the 3rd day but there is no option to do so, just wanted to give a heads up. If you do want to try this product out maybe order a smaller container before you commit to a 5 lb tub.

The protein I received appears near identical to the pictures in the listing except for one major thing. Look at the front of the jug in the listing and then look at mine. I do not have a section that says ""whey isolate and peptides - primary source."" And then look at my ingredient label and look at the ingredient label on the listing. On their listing, the more pure, more expensive Whey Isolate and Whey Peptides are the first ingredient. On mine, the cheaper, lower quality whey concentrate is the first ingredient. So it's a bait and switch. Their listing tells you that you will get a product that has higher quality whey isolate for the majority, whereas you actually receive whey concentrate as the majority. This is important for me as I have a little bit of lactose intolerance and whey isolate has most of the lactose removed. Nice try, but I wasn't fooled. I guess Ill still try to use it since it's the only protein I currently have, but now everyone can see the BS and be weary at least.

I have been bodybuilding for over 16 years now and i have had thousands of protein shakes!  For me, if a protein shake tastes great with just mixing it with water... you got a winner!!! I have heard plenty of people say it's not about the taste if you are serious enough as a lifter. Well, if you have gag reflexes every time you drink your protein drink, chances are that you will not be drinking that protein for very long regardless of how serious of a lifter you are! You have to have something that tastes relatively good. Nitro Tech Whey Gold Double Rich Chocolate is amazing! Over the years i have been increasingly impressed with how much better the taste of MuscleTech's protein powders have gotten. In the past they were great quality protein, but didn't taste the best. Now Nitro Tech Whey Gold Performance Series tastes incredible! I like to use cool water in a shaker cup and it simply tastes amazing! Reminds me of a chocolate malt! It's like Christmas day for me when i discover a new protein that tastes great because they are hard to come by. If you are a taste bud chaser when it comes to protein... this is wonderful product that you will have you running back to make more protein drinks! Happy lifting!

Cannot give 5 stars as this is the first time using any such product. I am 48 and have been on a consistent workout/body building regime. I take it once a day immediately after workouts 5 days a week.I also have my nutrition dialed in. I know I am doing those others things right, but it is not my first time getting in shape and have seen pretty good results. Its help me keep my protein macros where I need them by not taking in extra fat (This is not a replacement for food based protein).  I feel it has reduced my recovery time. Some could be contributed to increase workout frequency, but never saw such quick results, so I attribute ""some"" of the gains with the inclusion of this product.It tastes pretty good on its own, but mix with a half a banana a and a few ounces of skim milk and ice--you got yourself a pretty damn good smoothie treat.I will be buying more. (wish companies sold sampler packs to try different flavors)

We were very excited about this product and did all the research on the best protein powder to get. We looked at all the images of this product and the flavors and saw this product had the ingredients that we needed. However after getting the product shipped to us overnight we looked at the ingredients posted on the product they sent us and they are completely different and not up to the quality in which the product is advertised. Very disappointed!UPDATEAfter reading  Description I can see now there's a legal disclaimer that the product they send you can be different than the product that is posted in the images which is very sketchy in my books. Also I tried to initiate a return and this is an unreturnable item. Be very wary about buying this product

This is a great protein. It's straight to the point.Flavor: I'm a huge fan of chocolate (who isn't) so I got the Double Rich Chocolate flavor. It's great and it mixes well. I rotate mixing it with chocolate almond milk and peanut butter (in the morning when I wake up), and just with water after I work out. Can't go wrong with either one.Ingredients: Straight forward. It's a whey protein, containing amino acids. Good for muscle building. Low in fat / carbs so for those of you on a low carb diet, you won't be over doing it. For 31 scoops you can't go wrong for the price. I've seen a lot of protein that is upwards of 30 to 40 dollars and you end up with 18 servings (yeah no thanks).Effects: I used this protein almost everyday for the last several weeks. Haven't noticed any major changes in my lifting habits as far as strength is concerned. But I'm also nursing a shoulder injury when it comes to certain lifts.I recommend this product. Price is good, taste is good. You won't be disappointed.

Flavor is OK, a bit too artificially sweet but works well in smoothies to dilute this aspect. Mixes ok, but better when shaken or blended. Cholesterol content a bit high for a protein powder. Too many ingredients, lots of them should be left out honestly but they digested fine for me. Broke me out slightly more than other whey proteins, probably due to the other ingredients besides WPC and WPI. Was a good deal, the price was nice. Easy to blast through a tub of this. Easy to get someone not into fitness to drink it, since it's so non-hardcore tasting (unflavored whey anyone?) Would work better when mixed with another protein, something unflavored or casein for a mixed protein meal/shake. I mixed it with water, skim or 1% milk, or soymilk.

This is my first time to try MuscleTech protein powder. I had been eating Optimum protein powder before, but the Optimum protein powder does not have many flavors, so I want to try other brands. I have been eating this dulce de leche or caramel flavor MuscleTech protein powder for more than half a month, and it is very sweet but not bad for me. Maybe, I will try other flavors later, like strawberry flavor. However, in the beginning, I searched for a spoon in protein powder for a long time, and the handle of the spoon is too short to scoop the powder easily. It is inconvenient.  I think that these should be improved. Overall, this protein powder is nice. If you like sweet things, you can try caramel flavor.

I've tried my fair share of whey proteins over the years and for a long time I was using a popular store brand that had all the BCAA's included as well that I desired.  I didn't have any major gripe with it other than the price was hard to bite off for the quantity they offered. Since then I've discovered this protein and I have to say this is excellent stuff. I see the same, if not better, gains and recovery as I have with other brands with a similar composition but you get SO MUCH more for your money with this stuff.

Not only is it low carb, calorie and low in sugars, but it is an isolate and contains BCAAs too.The taste is great, although it is best with milk. Mixing it with water isn't bad either, however it does taste better with milk.The price they are selling this for is mind blowing.

I've never used supplements before, but I'm happy with this one.  It is made in the USA, from a reputable company and is easy to use.  I like that it says there are no banned substances in it.I just mix it up with 6 ounces of chilled tap water in one of those GNC shake mixer/tumbler sippy things.

I saw another reviewer post this and I must agree. Muscletech products are my go to products for all of my supplement needs. I have yet to have a bad experience with one of their products, and I've tried many of them. This particular protein powder is very good. It doesn't leave me feeling bloated or heavy in my stomach, and the taste is excellent. Not chalky at all. I mix almost all of my protein powders with ice, unsweetened cashew milk, and a tablespoon of peanut butter powder. I always get some version of chocolate, so I cannot speak to any other flavor.

This is my first time trying the Whey Gold from NitroTech. So far I'm enjoying this protein powder, given the value at its affordable price. I ordered the Strawberry flavor. At first, it took me a few days to get used to the taste. But after awhile, the artificial flavor resides and the drink tastes like strawberry milk. I used 8 oz. of unsweetend vanilla almond milk and that's perfect for me. If you don't blend enough milk with the powder, it ends up tasting very sugary. So adjust the milk ratio to your liking. I don't recommend mixing this with water, it's gross in my opinion. I also like blending frozen strawberries in, you can make a berry shake!

I always check the quality of my protein pouring boiling water on top of the protein. If your protein coagulates and make something like a lumps it means that is a real protein. Many fake whey proteins don’t make lumps and just dissolves completely like a milk powder.I’ve got this 5.5lb of Muscletech for an amazing price so I decided to test it same day to make sure it’s not fake. I can tell that’s a real protein. Good quality. Good price. Good deal! Photo attached!

When I opened it today it's super clumpy and sticky. The flavor is also off. I tried blending it and it looks like it's spoiled.

It has a great taste but when you take it make sure you get ready because you might feel tired or have a an angry stomach so if it is your first time just try it before fully buying this because it may different effects on everyone else’s stomach

This is my second buy and i am very satisfied with the protein powder. It has good taste better than before with this new one, plus it absorbs fast, gives mucles enough protein which is needed and doesn’t fill up your stomach like some others do.

I'm not sure whether it works well yet as I started it today , but I guess the taste is just ok. It's not too strong tasting, more like a strawberry shake as I used vanilla almond milk, it's not as bad tasting as some I have had  and it blends pretty well , I guess time will tell to how it works . I'm not sure they sure as to whether will buy it again , will see

I really like this product so far. I feel it has all the best components for a protein powder with a good price point. I tried this with water. Absolutely...DISGUSTING. That’s the reason for the 4 stars. It made me feel sick to my stomach. I didn’t feel “right” for like 2 days. However, when I paired it with chocolate oat milk it tasted great ! The oat milk gave it a more chocolatey taste.

The chocolate flavor is great, so I thought I’d give the vanilla a try, but that was a mistake. The vanilla flavor is AWFUL!!! I don’t know why, but it is not tolerable in any form. I have used it in baked good, smoothies, shakes, etc., and the unpleasant artificial vanilla flavor cannot be masked at all. I cannot even get my kids to eat/drink it.

The French vanilla cream flavor is really bad. I could say it’s the worst flavor I’ve ever tasted in proteins. Besides that, the product is premium.
