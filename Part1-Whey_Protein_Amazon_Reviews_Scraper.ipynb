Given how depleting it can be to run for prolonged periods of time, I like to have an electrolyte drink after my cardio days on the treadmill to try to restore my electrolytes. After having tried this electrolyte drink mix, I must say that I am rather impressed.This chocolate flavored hydration mix actually tastes better than I thought it would. I was a little bit hesitant as I have normally only had fruity-flavored electrolyte drink mixes before, and nothing I have had was similar to the rich flavor of chocolate. However, after having a mix with 8 ounces of water, I was surprised to note that it tasted like hot chocolate - although cold, because I did not use hot water. At 8 ounces of water, it did taste a bit watered down still. I believe that this drink will be most enjoyable if used with hot water or milk for a richer taste, and potentially with less water than they recommend (they recommend 8 to 16 ounces of water per stick).There are a couple of flaws that I have with this product. Firstly, the drink mix did not fully dissolve well. Some other electrolyte drink mixes that I have used have dissolved better than this one. Also, for this drink mix to be most enjoyable, I believe one should use milk or hot water (or hot milk, for that matter). This is an extra step versus with fruity flavors that can be very enjoyable in cold water (from the sink for me). As I enjoy convenience and wouldn't want to heat water each time before use, this is a flaw for me.I like how these sticks have a good vitamin profile. Each stick has significant amount of Vitamin C, B6, and B12, as well as some zinc. You're getting more than just electrolytes with these sticks. There are 2.5 grams of added sugar per stick, which is higher than I typically like as I try to avoid added sugar. But, there are only 10 calories per stick, so if you're a calorie counter, these might be for you.Given the rather affordable price of these electrolyte sticks ($36 for 30 sticks at the time of writing), I think that these could certainly be worth it for those who enjoy the hot chocolate flavor. Given the flaws that I personally have found with these, I will give them 4 stars.\\n</td>\n",

I do notice that it makes me less thirsty throughout the morning after ingesting this, so there’s that.POSITIVES:- Tastes great for a hydration packet mix. If the packaging holds true, it also does not contain extra carbs either.- Portable; you can take these with you anywhere.- Highly dissolvable (is that a word?), you can use these with cold, hot drinks and anywhere in between.- Individual packets can easily be opened; no need for a knife or scrips or.NEGATIVES:- Nothing comes to mind, just hoping they work as advertised.IMPROVEMENTS:- None\\n</td>\n",

I’ve only tried it with hot water (like a hot cocoa) and I was surprised by how much chocolate flavor there was.

Option to mix/shake with milk for thicker and creamier taste.Contains a good assortment of Vitamins, minerals, and salts (Sodium and Potassium) for hydration.No added caffeine for those of us sensitive to it.We all felt hydrated without muscle cramps during our training sessions.What may not work:This hydration mix only works well for our low intensity/aerobic exercise sessions of 45 minutes or less because it doesn't contain any significant calories (10) from carbs, fats, or proteins to fuel longer, higher intensity training/workouts.  YMMV\\n</td>\n",

I was really excited to try this mix because it says you can mix it with hot water and make hot chocolate with it. I used my keurig to brew 10 oz of hot water and I stirred in one packet of this afterwards. It mixes well and I love drinking it after a nighttime workout to warm up, relax and feel refreshed.\\n</td>\n",

It says you can mix a packet with 8 or 16 ounces of water, and both do work for me. This dissolved in a glass of water to my satisfaction just stirring with a spoon, but a shaker jar will work as well. I feel satiated after one glass and I’m hydrated. I like the B vitamins, and vitamin C as well as the electrolytes. Only 10 calories, 2.5 g sugar and I love the flavor. Very satisfying!\\n</td>\n",

You can suggest add more water then, but I did and it ends up tasting like a washed up chocolate drink. I also taste the strong salt on it so it’s like drinking a very sweet and salty drink for me. Strange flavor. The sodium content is 250mg though it’s medically considered low dose, for those who have sensitive taste buds you will definitely notice it.Also this uses sucralose as a sweetener so if you’re not a fan of it just fyi.Did it gives me the extra boost for my day? Unfortunately it gives me a headache that I have to drink tons of water to washed it down my body, half my day I have to deal with the headache and I’m not the kind who can take pain killer coz it gives me tummy ache so I just have to deal with it.\\n</td>\n",

I make it for myself and my kids as hot chocolate or “chocolate milk” and the taste is so good they have no idea it’s good for them. Other brands taste like medicine, this is just delicious.

       "4   \\nI like to work out regularly. This includes weight-lifting on some days and running on the treadmill for other days. Given how depleting it can be to run for prolonged periods of time, I like to have an electrolyte drink after my cardio days on the treadmill to try to restore my electrolytes. After having tried this electrolyte drink mix, I must say that I am rather impressed.This chocolate flavored hydration mix actually tastes better than I thought it would. I was a little bit hesitant as I have normally only had fruity-flavored electrolyte drink mixes before, and nothing I have had was similar to the rich flavor of chocolate. However, after having a mix with 8 ounces of water, I was surprised to note that it tasted like hot chocolate - although cold, because I did not use hot water. At 8 ounces of water, it did taste a bit watered down still. I believe that this drink will be most enjoyable if used with hot water or milk for a richer taste, and potentially with less water than they recommend (they recommend 8 to 16 ounces of water per stick).There are a couple of flaws that I have with this product. Firstly, the drink mix did not fully dissolve well. Some other electrolyte drink mixes that I have used have dissolved better than this one. Also, for this drink mix to be most enjoyable, I believe one should use milk or hot water (or hot milk, for that matter). This is an extra step versus with fruity flavors that can be very enjoyable in cold water (from the sink for me). As I enjoy convenience and wouldn't want to heat water each time before use, this is a flaw for me.I like how these sticks have a good vitamin profile. Each stick has significant amount of Vitamin C, B6, and B12, as well as some zinc. You're getting more than just electrolytes with these sticks. There are 2.5 grams of added sugar per stick, which is higher than I typically like as I try to avoid added sugar. But, there are only 10 calories per stick, so if you're a calorie counter, these might be for you.Given the rather affordable price of these electrolyte sticks ($36 for 30 sticks at the time of writing), I think that these could certainly be worth it for those who enjoy the hot chocolate flavor. Given the flaws that I personally have found with these, I will give them 4 stars.\\n   \n",

This is like having portable yoohoo everywhere you go! My only negative is that the flavor isn't as robust as the \"real thing\", but it's very, very good. The packets are strong and would be fine to travel with -- I had no concerns with the package being flimsy or difficult to open. The additive did dissolve fully for me, which is something that's a big point of interest for me. Flavor is good! Like watery chocolate, again, a neat and unique flavor additive. The packaging notes you can also try this hot, but I put this in cold water and enjoyed.\\n   \n",

Almost as good as regular hot chocolate, although you do taste that extra saltiness associated with hydration mixes.Honestly do not know if it works or not; how do you measure your body is getting hydration from a packet? I do notice that it makes me less thirsty throughout the morning after ingesting this, so there’s that.POSITIVES:- Tastes great for a hydration packet mix. If the packaging holds true, it also does not contain extra carbs either.- Portable; you can take these with you anywhere.- Highly dissolvable (is that a word?), you can use these with cold, hot drinks and anywhere in between.- Individual packets can easily be opened; no need for a knife or scrips or.NEGATIVES:- Nothing comes to mind, just hoping they work as advertised.IMPROVEMENTS:- None\\n   \n",

I preferred adding a stick to hot water as the chocolate flavor was very unappealing when combined with cold water on its own. The sticks themselves are durable, and wouldn't tear easily if left to bounce around freely at the bottom of a gym bag.\\n   \n",

Especially when mixing with water… it just doesn’t sound good. BUT I was really surprised by how much I liked this product! I’ve only tried it with hot water (like a hot cocoa) and I was surprised by how much chocolate flavor there was. It would probably be better with warm milk but I wanted to try it with water first and I was not disappointed. Overall, I liked this and I will definitely use them for before/after workouts. I’m excited to try it with milk to see if it’s even better than with the water. Will update if I remember!\\n   \n",

Ingredients are pretty simple, and it contains a high DV of vitamins. I've been having these as a hot drink with hot water, and its like drinking hot cocoa. Its not as sweet or rich as regular hot cocoa, but its pretty close in my opinion. It does have that diet/alternative sugar taste, but it subtle to me so I don't notice it as much.This has been a nice to drink in the cold winter days especially in the morning. I tried putting it in my coffee but it doesn't seem to taste great with the blend I have. Maybe when the weather gets warmer I can try to to use these in smoothies. Overall, I've enjoyed these chocolate drinks and would recommend it for those looking for a healthier option!!\\n   \n",

There is a strong salty flavor, but the chocolate pairs well with it. Still, 250mg of sodium isn't terribly much for an \"electrolyte\" drink. I don't care for the smell of powder, but once mixed it is fine. It dissolves fairly easily and individual sachets make it easy to take a few with you when traveling. At a dollar per packet I don't think these are a great value, for example a chocolate protein powder would be a much better value.\\n   \n",

Suggesting it might replace an IV treatment to recharge the body with accelerated hydration might well be true, but we have no imperial evidence of such.The potassium, sodium, Vitamin C and magnesium and low sugar are certainly a good recipe for a morning lift -- an energizing boost to start the day -- and the chocolate flavor makes it all go down with ease.We keep them in our travel case for general jet lag symptoms and energy boost on long trips. It's good to have a few along in case of a touch of the hangover syndrome.\\n   \n",

Option to mix/shake with milk for thicker and creamier taste.Contains a good assortment of Vitamins, minerals, and salts (Sodium and Potassium) for hydration.No added caffeine for those of us sensitive to it.We all felt hydrated without muscle cramps during our training sessions.What may not work:This hydration mix only works well for our low intensity/aerobic exercise sessions of 45 minutes or less because it doesn't contain any significant calories (10) from carbs, fats, or proteins to fuel longer, higher intensity training/workouts.

They come in 30 individual packets which is nice and convenient. The package says to mix with 8-16 ounces of water, so I chose 8 because that’s a big gap. It does taste like chocolate, a little weak, but chocolate nonetheless. It’s kind of odd because when I taste chocolate I expect a level of “creaminess” and since this is to be mixed with water it’s not there lol. Overall it’s not bad, but I’m still unsure about how I feel.\\n   \n",

Chocolate complements the salt and masks the bitterness well.This powder is one of the tastier electrolyte drinks. No question about that. The ingredients are also well-considered. The one thing I wish were different is the sucralose. Sucralose, ace-k, sugar alcohols, and aspartame all can cause issues for people with allergies or diabetes or other sensitivities. There are better choices.\\n   \n",

But surprisingly, this works for me.I'm also not used to chocolate products that can be mixed with cold water.  But I mixed this with ice water and the product completely mixed with a little agitation.The packets are easy to open, but not so easy that there is a risk of opening by accident.The flavor is a little sweet, a little chocolatey... but not like chocolate milk.The description talks about a boost of energy.  But there isn't much sugar.  I don't see anything to indicate that it has caffeine (an artificial boost), or any other ingredient that would explain the energy boost.  But I can confirm that after my workout, I felt a little sluggish until I drank my HydroMATE drink.  That is to say... I did feel that I got a boost of energy.This is certainly travel friendly.  Weather you're traveling on a plane where you're only allowed to carry powders... or if you're just traveling to the gym.  Since this is an individual serving packet, you also don't have to measure and be concerned about making a mess.  The packets easily empty into a \"normal\" water bottle, so you don't even need a wide mouth.\\n   \n",

But for me I had a after taste, not bad after taste but there was one.  But after taking this to the gym and work I really didn't have the after taste anymore or I just got use to it.  Value for the money is ok at about $1.50 a drink it isn't that bad. (I've had better priced ones but not that great on flavor.)  I do wish it gave some protein with the drink, I'm not sure if it has any protein content but it would be nice to have some after working out.  I believe I would get this again because my kids like it and it is a good change from heavy sugar drinks out there.\\n   \n",

I once ordered an apple cinnamon one and regretted it my whole hike. It was great at home but not much as thirst-quenching hydration. I was expecting this to taste like watered-down Yoohoo.You get the potassium chloride and all the other elements and vitamins you get with your sports drink, but this is an excellent way to start your morning. I tried it hot in coconut and almond milk, and in my coffee as a mocha with some cinnamon. I have dehydration from gut issues, so I get dehydrated after my third cup of coffee in the morning. This is an excellent addition to kick off your morning. The flavor is chocolatey and delicious without being overly sweet. And thanks to it being keto-friendly, I don't spike my sugar as I do with high-glucose sports drinks.You aren't going to fill your hydration pack with it for hiking, but a thermos of this hot chocolate for a hiking break is outstanding. A delicious treat that replaces essential elements lost while being active. My boyfriend has already mowed through 10 packets in 4 days!\\n   \n",

I was a little skeptical about the chocolate flavor, but its not that bad. It is a bit weird with water; it kind of tastes like if you had a Yoohoo with ice, drank all the Yoohoo, let the ice melt a bit, and drank that. Just really watered down Yoohoo. Apparently you can make it hot or even add it to milk, so that might be tasty. I guess if you're really craving chocolate and this is the only way to get it, its clutch. Otherwise, it's just okay.\\n   \n",

That's weird'. But I do love chocolate and, as a competitive triathlete, I use hydration mixes frequently. I figured I needed to at least try it. Turns out this hydration mix is really good! I was surprised. It has a subtle, sweet chocolate flavor. It's a lot different in terms of flavor than any other hydration mix I've tried. The other cool thing about this hydration mix is that you can make hot chocolate with it! It's great for staying hydrated when it's cold, or after a long run in cold weather (also, it's very good when you make it with warm milk/milk substitute). I like that it contains electrolytes as well as zinc and some B vitamins. If you are bored of all the fruity hydration mix flavors, and you like chocolate, I would recommend this product.\\n   \n",

Normally I drink about 100 Oz of water a day, but when I drink that much water, I have to go to the restroom about every 30 min to an hour. This can be very frustrating, especially when at work. I notice that if I add this to my daily protein drinks, I definitely don’t go to the restroom as much. I really like how few calories it has. As far as taste goes, I add this to my protein drink that already tastes like chocolate so I can’t really speak to that. I would definitely reorder these 👍🏻\\n   \n",

Tasted like salty chocolate milk, which (like chocolate bars with sea salt) is actually quite delicious. Did not expect an electrolyte drink with just sodium and chloride to elevate me this much, but it did. Drinking it after pouring sweat for a bit gave me a noticeable boost I wasn't getting from a regular beverage. There are more sophisticated electrolyte mixes on the market, but this one worked very well for me.EDIT: Dunno why I thought this was just sodium and chloride. Significantly, there is also potassium, magnesium, and a number of B Vitamins. This IS a fairly sophisticated electrolyte drink.\\n   \n",

The salt is a kick like the salted caramel coffee drinks one can get at a coffee shop, and if you are sensitive to the aftertaste of sugar-substitutes you'll still taste it. But it isn't overpowering as it can be in other electrolyte packets.Very happy I came across this product and looking forward to using it often in training!\\n   \n",

They don't smell so good, but it mixes well and quickly. They are perfect to just poor into a water bottle, shake, and drink. They taste so good, you wouldn't know they were good for you in any way. It resembles yoo-hoo or chocolate milk. I've only drank it cold, but I'm sure it would taste good heated up. I absolutely love this drink mix and so does my daughter. This is the best hydrating drink I've ever had and so glad I learned it exists so we can get more.\\n   \n",

I was really excited to try this mix because it says you can mix it with hot water and make hot chocolate with it. I used my keurig to brew 10 oz of hot water and I stirred in one packet of this afterwards. It mixes well and I love drinking it after a nighttime workout to warm up, relax and feel refreshed.\\n   \n",

It says you can mix a packet with 8 or 16 ounces of water, and both do work for me. This dissolved in a glass of water to my satisfaction just stirring with a spoon, but a shaker jar will work as well. I feel satiated after one glass and I’m hydrated. I like the B vitamins, and vitamin C as well as the electrolytes. Only 10 calories, 2.5 g sugar and I love the flavor. Very satisfying!\\n   \n",

My only complaint is that you mix it with 8 oz of water, which is a fairly small serving if you're trying to rehydrate, but of course you can just drink water after this,\\n   \n",

First off, I’m not a big fan of super sweet food/drinks so this is definitely not for me. You can suggest add more water then, but I did and it ends up tasting like a washed up chocolate drink. I also taste the strong salt on it so it’s like drinking a very sweet and salty drink for me. Strange flavor. The sodium content is 250mg though it’s medically considered low dose, for those who have sensitive taste buds you will definitely notice it.Also this uses sucralose as a sweetener so if you’re not a fan of it just fyi.Did it gives me the extra boost for my day? Unfortunately it gives me a headache that I have to drink tons of water to washed it down my body, half my day I have to deal with the headache and I’m not the kind who can take pain killer coz it gives me tummy ache so I just have to deal with it.\\n   \n",
